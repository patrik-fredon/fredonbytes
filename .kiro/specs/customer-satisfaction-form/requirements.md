# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a dynamic customer satisfaction survey system for FredonBytes. The feature will enable the company to collect structured feedback from clients through a personalized, session-based form accessible via unique URLs. The system will integrate with Supabase (PostgreSQL) for data persistence, support multiple question types, implement local caching for improved user experience, and maintain visual consistency with the existing FredonBytes brand identity.

The form will be accessible through email links sent to customers, with each session uniquely identified to track responses and prevent duplicate submissions. The implementation will follow FredonBytes' existing tech stack (Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion) and design patterns to ensure seamless integration with the current website.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Session Management and Access Control

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to access a unique survey form through a personalized link, so that my responses are tracked individually and I can resume the survey if interrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses `/form` without a session_id THEN the system SHALL generate a unique UUID session_id and redirect to `/form/{session_id}`
2. WHEN a session_id is generated THEN the system SHALL store it in localStorage with a 24-hour expiration timestamp
3. WHEN a user accesses `/form/{session_id}` with a valid session_id THEN the system SHALL load the form interface
4. WHEN a user returns within 24 hours THEN the system SHALL retrieve the cached session_id from localStorage and restore their progress
5. IF localStorage contains an expired session_id (>24 hours) THEN the system SHALL clear the expired data and generate a new session_id
6. WHEN a user accesses the form via email link THEN the system SHALL accept the session_id from the URL parameter

### Requirement 2: Dynamic Question Loading and Display

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want questions to be loaded dynamically from the database, so that I can update survey content without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the form page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch all questions from the Supabase `questions` table ordered by display sequence
2. WHEN fetching questions THEN the system SHALL retrieve Question text, Description, AnswerType, Required flag, and display order
3. IF the database query fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide a retry option
4. WHEN questions are loaded THEN the system SHALL support the following AnswerType values: 'short_text', 'long_text', 'single_choice', 'multiple_choice', 'checklist'
5. WHEN displaying a question THEN the system SHALL render the appropriate input component based on AnswerType
6. WHEN a question has AnswerType 'single_choice' or 'multiple_choice' THEN the system SHALL fetch and display available options from the database
7. WHEN a question is marked as Required=true THEN the system SHALL display a visual indicator (asterisk or label)

### Requirement 3: User Interface and Navigation

**User Story:** As a customer, I want an intuitive and visually appealing form interface with smooth navigation, so that completing the survey is a pleasant experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN the user is viewing a question (not the first) THEN the system SHALL display both "Previous" and "Next" buttons
5. WHEN the user clicks "Previous" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the previous question with a slide-left animation
6. WHEN the user clicks "Next" THEN the system SHALL navigate to the next question with a slide-right animation
7. WHEN the user attempts to proceed from a required question without answering THEN the system SHALL display a validation error message and prevent navigation
8. WHEN displaying the form THEN the system SHALL use a centered container with a blurred background image matching FredonBytes branding
9. WHEN the form is viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain full responsiveness and touch-friendly controls
10. WHEN transitions occur THEN the system SHALL use Framer Motion for smooth fade/slide animations with 300ms duration

### Requirement 4: Answer Collection and Local Storage

**User Story:** As a customer, I want my answers to be saved automatically as I progress, so that I don't lose my responses if I accidentally close the browser.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides an answer to a question THEN the system SHALL immediately save the answer to localStorage
2. WHEN saving to localStorage THEN the system SHALL store answers in a structured format keyed by session_id
3. WHEN a user returns to a previously answered question THEN the system SHALL pre-populate the input with their saved answer
4. WHEN localStorage data is saved THEN the system SHALL include a timestamp for 24-hour expiration validation
5. IF localStorage is unavailable or disabled THEN the system SHALL maintain answers in component state and warn the user that progress won't persist
6. WHEN the user completes all questions THEN the system SHALL retain localStorage data until successful submission to the database

### Requirement 5: Form Submission and Data Persistence

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want customer responses to be securely stored in the database, so that I can analyze feedback and track satisfaction trends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user completes the final question and clicks "Next" THEN the system SHALL validate all required questions are answered
2. IF any required questions are unanswered THEN the system SHALL navigate to the first unanswered required question and display an error message
3. WHEN all validations pass THEN the system SHALL submit answers to Supabase in a single transaction
4. WHEN submitting to Supabase THEN the system SHALL store session_id, question_id, answer_value, and submission_timestamp for each response
5. IF the database submission fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message, retain localStorage data, and provide a retry option
6. WHEN submission succeeds THEN the system SHALL clear the localStorage data for that session_id
7. WHEN submission succeeds THEN the system SHALL trigger an admin notification email via the Resend API
8. WHEN the admin email is sent THEN it SHALL include session_id, submission timestamp, and a summary of responses

### Requirement 6: Completion Flow and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a customer, I want clear confirmation that my survey was submitted successfully, so that I know my feedback was received.
