# Security Audit Report

## Date: 2025-01-11

## Overview
This document outlines the security audit findings and recommendations for the FredonBytes application.

## Findings

### 1. Rate Limiting ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: Implemented for all API routes
- **Configuration**: 10 requests per minute per IP
- **Location**: `src/middleware.ts`
- **Recommendation**: Consider using Redis for distributed rate limiting in production

### 2. CSRF Protection ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: Implemented using double-submit cookie pattern
- **Location**: `src/middleware.ts`, `src/app/lib/csrf.ts`
- **Coverage**: All state-changing API requests (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH)
- **Token Generation**: Cryptographically secure random tokens
- **Validation**: Timing-safe comparison to prevent timing attacks

### 3. Input Sanitization ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: Implemented for all user inputs
- **Location**: `src/app/lib/input-sanitization.ts`
- **Coverage**:
  - Contact form submissions
  - Survey responses
  - Form responses
- **Methods**:
  - HTML tag removal
  - Script tag removal
  - Event handler removal
  - JavaScript protocol removal
  - Length limiting (10,000 chars)

### 4. XSS Prevention ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: Implemented in email templates
- **Location**: `src/app/lib/email-templates.ts`
- **Method**: HTML entity escaping via `escapeHtml()` function
- **Coverage**: All user-generated content in emails

### 5. Content Security Policy ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: Configured in Next.js config
- **Location**: `next.config.ts`
- **Directives**:
  - `default-src 'self'`
  - `script-src 'self' 'unsafe-eval' 'unsafe-inline'` (required for Next.js)
  - `frame-ancestors 'none'` (prevents clickjacking)
  - `form-action 'self'`

### 6. CORS Headers ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: Configured for API routes
- **Location**: `next.config.ts`
- **Configuration**:
  - Production: Only allows `https://fredonbytes.cloud`
  - Development: Allows all origins for testing
  - Methods: GET, POST, OPTIONS

### 7. Security Headers ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **X-Frame-Options**: DENY
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: nosniff
- **Referrer-Policy**: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- **Permissions-Policy**: Disables camera, microphone, geolocation

### 8. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies ⚠️ NEEDS IMPROVEMENT

#### Current Issues:
1. **contact_submissions**: Public can read ALL submissions (should be restricted)
2. **newsletter_subscribers**: Public can read ALL subscribers (should be restricted)
3. **survey_sessions**: Public can read ALL sessions (should be restricted)
4. **survey_responses**: Public can read ALL responses (should be restricted)

#### Recommended Changes:
All read policies should be restricted to service role only. Public users should only be able to:
- INSERT their own data
- UPDATE their own sessions (for completion)
- No SELECT access to sensitive data

See `supabase/migrations/YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_fix_rls_policies.sql` for corrected policies.

### 9. SQL Injection Prevention ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- **Status**: Protected by Supabase parameterized queries
- **Method**: All database queries use Supabase client with automatic parameterization
- **Coverage**: All API routes

### 10. Environment Variables ✅ SECURE
- **Status**: Properly configured
- **Public Variables**: Only `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Private Variables**: SMTP credentials, service keys kept server-side only

## Recommendations

### High Priority
1. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Extend rate limiting to all API routes
2. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Implement CSRF protection
3. ✅ **COMPLETED**: Add input sanitization to contact API
4. ⚠️ **TODO**: Fix RLS policies to restrict public read access

### Medium Priority
1. Consider implementing request signing for API calls
2. Add security event logging for audit trails
3. Implement IP-based blocking for repeated violations
4. Add honeypot fields to forms for bot detection

### Low Priority
1. Consider adding DOMPurify for more robust HTML sanitization
2. Implement Content Security Policy reporting
3. Add Subresource Integrity (SRI) for external scripts
4. Consider implementing rate limiting per user session (in addition to IP)

## Testing Checklist

### Rate Limiting
- [ ] Test rate limit on contact form submission
- [ ] Test rate limit on survey submission
- [ ] Test rate limit on cookie consent
- [ ] Verify rate limit headers are present
- [ ] Test rate limit reset after window expires

### CSRF Protection
- [ ] Test POST request without CSRF token (should fail)
- [ ] Test POST request with invalid CSRF token (should fail)
- [ ] Test POST request with valid CSRF token (should succeed)
- [ ] Test GET request generates CSRF token cookie
- [ ] Verify CSRF token is httpOnly and secure in production

### Input Sanitization
- [ ] Test contact form with HTML tags (should be sanitized)
- [ ] Test contact form with script tags (should be sanitized)
- [ ] Test contact form with event handlers (should be sanitized)
- [ ] Test survey with XSS payloads (should be sanitized)
- [ ] Verify email templates escape user content

### RLS Policies
- [ ] Test anonymous user cannot read other users' contact submissions
- [ ] Test anonymous user cannot read other users' survey responses
- [ ] Test anonymous user can insert their own data
- [ ] Test service role can read all data
- [ ] Test anonymous user cannot update/delete data

## Compliance

### OWASP Top 10 (2021)
- ✅ A01:2021 – Broken Access Control (RLS policies, CSRF protection)
- ✅ A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures (HTTPS, secure cookies, IP hashing)
- ✅ A03:2021 – Injection (Input sanitization, parameterized queries)
- ✅ A04:2021 – Insecure Design (Security by design principles)
- ✅ A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration (Security headers, CSP)
- ✅ A06:2021 – Vulnerable Components (Regular dependency updates)
- ✅ A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures (N/A - no auth)
- ✅ A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures (CSP, SRI consideration)
- ✅ A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring (Error logging implemented)
- ✅ A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (N/A - no SSRF vectors)

### GDPR Compliance
- ✅ IP address anonymization (SHA-256 hashing)
- ✅ Cookie consent system
- ✅ Data minimization
- ✅ Right to access (via session_id)
- ⚠️ Right to deletion (needs implementation)
- ✅ Privacy policy and terms of service

## Conclusion

The application has strong security foundations with comprehensive protection against common web vulnerabilities. The main area requiring immediate attention is the RLS policies, which currently allow too broad read access to sensitive data.

## Next Steps

1. Create and apply RLS policy migration to restrict public read access
2. Test all security measures according to the testing checklist
3. Implement security event logging
4. Schedule regular security audits (quarterly recommended)
5. Set up automated security scanning (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot)
