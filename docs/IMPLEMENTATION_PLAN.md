# 1.1 Text Extraction

## Context

This subtask is part of Phase 1 (I18N Implementation) of the "Project Refinement" initiative. It aims to prepare the codebase for internationalization by extracting all visible UI text, enabling future translation and localization efforts.

## Scope

- Scan the entire codebase for visible text in UI components.
- Identify all user-facing strings, including labels, buttons, headings, and messages.
- Exclude non-UI or backend-only text.
- Document each string and its source location.

## Expected Output

- `text_strings.json`: A JSON file containing all extracted UI text strings.
- `i18n_key_mapping`: A mapping of original text to i18n keys for integration.
- All UI text elements identified and extracted.

## Additional Resources

- Reference best practices for i18n text extraction in React/Next.js projects.
- Consider using tools like i18next-scanner or custom scripts for automation.

# 1.2 Translation Integration

## Context

This subtask follows text extraction and focuses on integrating translations into the UI. It ensures that all user-facing elements render content based on locale files, supporting multiple languages.

## Scope

- Implement translation files for supported locales.
- Update UI components to use i18n keys instead of hardcoded text.
- Exclude non-UI and backend-only text from translation.
- Validate that all UI elements render translated content.

## Expected Output

- `locale_files`: Translation files for each supported language.
- `i18n_config_updates`: Configuration changes to enable i18n in the application.
- All UI elements render translated content.

## Additional Resources

- Reference i18n integration guides for Next.js/React.
- Use automated tests to verify translation coverage.

- Document all removals and changes for traceability.

## Expected Output

- `deduplicated_code`: Cleaned codebase with duplicates removed.
- `removed_files_log`: Log file detailing all removed or consolidated items.
- Zero duplicated files/functions in codebase.

## Additional Resources

- Use code analysis tools to detect duplicates.
- Reference refactoring best practices.
