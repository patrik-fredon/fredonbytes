## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Vercel Deployment Critical Fixes** (November 1, 2025)
  - **Tailwind CSS Build Failure**: Downgraded from v4.1.14 to v3.4.17 due to experimental v4 compatibility issues with Vercel's webpack build pipeline
    - Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'All')` at `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin
    - Root cause: Tailwind v4 `@import "tailwindcss"` syntax and `@tailwindcss/postcss` plugin fail in Vercel production builds
    - Solution: Migrated to stable v3 with `@tailwind base/components/utilities` directives
    - Modified: `package.json`, `globals.css`, `postcss.config.mjs`
  - **Tailwind Content Array Fix**: Fixed broken styling (missing backgrounds, transparent buttons, invisible header/footer) caused by incomplete content paths
    - Issue: `tailwind.config.ts` content array missing catch-all `"./src/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}"` pattern
    - Result: Tailwind v3 purged critical utility classes not found in scanned files
    - Solution: Restored complete content array with catch-all pattern and CSS modules support
    - Modified: `tailwind.config.ts`
  - **Manifest 401 Error**: Fixed `/manifest.webmanifest` returning 401 Unauthorized by adding explicit middleware exclusion for Next.js metadata routes
    - Modified: `middleware.ts` to skip rate limiting/CSRF for manifest, robots, and sitemap
  - **CSP Enhancements**: Updated Content Security Policy headers to properly support:
    - Vercel Live preview tools (`frame-src`)
    - Google Fonts integration (`style-src`, `font-src`)
