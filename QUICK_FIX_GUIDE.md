# Quick Fix Guide - RLS Policy & Metadata Issues

## üî¥ Critical: Fix RLS Policy Error (Do This First!)

Your form submission is failing because of Row Level Security policies. 

### Fix Steps:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project
   - Click **"SQL Editor"** ‚Üí **"New query"**

2. **Run the fix script:**
   - Copy the entire content from `scripts/fix-rls-policies.sql`
   - Paste into SQL Editor
   - Click **"Run"**

3. **Verify the fix:**
   - You should see a list of policies at the bottom
   - Look for policies with `TO public` (not `TO anon`)

### What Changed:

The original policies used `TO anon` which is too restrictive. The fix changes them to `TO public` which allows both anonymous and authenticated users.

**Before:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can create sessions"
ON form_sessions FOR INSERT
TO anon  -- ‚ùå Too restrictive
WITH CHECK (true);
```

**After:**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Public can create sessions"
ON form_sessions FOR INSERT
TO public  -- ‚úÖ Correct
WITH CHECK (true);
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. **Run the RLS fix script** in Supabase (critical!)
2. **Restart dev server** to see the changes
3. **Test form submission** to verify it works
4. **Deploy to production** when ready

---

## üÜò If Still Having Issues

### Issue: Form still fails with 500 error

**Check:**
1. Did you run `scripts/fix-rls-policies.sql` in Supabase?
2. Are you using the correct Supabase URL and anon key in `.env`?
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages

**Verify RLS policies:**
```sql
SELECT tablename, policyname, roles 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'form_sessions';
```

Should show `roles = {public}` not `roles = {anon}`

### Issue: Metadata warnings still appear

**Solution:**
- Restart your dev server completely
- Clear Next.js cache: `rm -rf .next`
- Run `npm run dev` again

---

## ‚úÖ Expected Results

After applying all fixes:

1. **No RLS errors** - Form submissions work
2. **No metadata warnings** - Clean console output
3. **Form works end-to-end** - Data saved to Supabase
4. **Email sent** - Admin receives notification (if SMTP configured)
