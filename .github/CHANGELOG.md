# Changelog

This repository follows a standard changelog at the repository root.

If a `CHANGELOG.md` exists in the project root, it contains the chronological changelog entries. If not, maintainers should add release notes here or create a root-level `CHANGELOG.md`.

### How to add a changelog entry

- Add a new entry at the top of `CHANGELOG.md` (root) with a version and short summary.
- Use semantic versions and short, meaningful descriptions.
