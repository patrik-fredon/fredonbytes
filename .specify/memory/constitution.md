# Fredonbytes Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Accessibility-First
All user interfaces MUST achieve AAA-level WCAG 2.1 compliance with full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and inclusive design practices. Accessibility is not optional - it is a fundamental requirement that cannot be compromised for any feature or deadline.

### II. Performance-Optimized
Applications MUST maintain Lighthouse scores above 95 across all metrics with optimized Core Web Vitals. Performance is measured and enforced through automated testing, with no exceptions for "acceptable" degradation.

### III. Security & Privacy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
GDPR compliance and secure data handling are mandatory requirements. Cookie consent management, secure API endpoints, and privacy-by-design principles must be implemented in every feature. Security violations block all deployments.

### IV. Type-Safe Development
TypeScript is mandatory with strict type checking enabled. All code must compile without type errors, and type safety cannot be bypassed with any or loose typing. Type definitions must be comprehensive and accurate.

### V. Internationalization
Multi-language support with proper localization is required for all user-facing content. Translation files must be complete and validated, with cultural adaptation considerations for date formats, currency, and regional preferences.

## Technical Standards

### Technology Stack Requirements
- **Framework**: Next.js 15+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.9+ with strict mode
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4+ with custom design system
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Email**: Resend API for transactional emails
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for smooth transitions

### Deployment & Infrastructure
- **Hosting**: Vercel (recommended) or equivalent Next.js-compatible platform
- **Build Process**: Automated CI/CD with type checking and linting gates
- **Environment Management**: Environment variables for all configuration
- **Monitoring**: Performance monitoring and error tracking required

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- **Linting**: ESLint with Next.js configuration, zero warnings allowed
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript compilation must pass without errors
- **Testing**: Form validation and accessibility testing required
- **Build Validation**: Production build must succeed before deployment

### Review & Deployment Process
- **Code Review**: Required for all changes with accessibility and performance checklists
- **Branch Protection**: Main branch protected with required status checks
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment on merge to main with rollback capability
- **Documentation**: README and API documentation must be current

## Governance

All PRs/reviews must verify compliance with constitution principles. Complexity must be justified with performance impact analysis. Use project documentation for runtime development guidance.
