# Project Gallery Animations Implementation

## Completed: Task 5.5 - Implement Animations with Framer Motion

### Overview
Enhanced the project gallery with comprehensive Framer Motion animations including entrance animations, hover effects, stagger animations, and full support for reduced motion preferences.

### Changes Made

#### 1. ProjectCard Component (`src/app/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`)

**Interface Update:**
- Added `index: number` prop to `ProjectCardProps` interface
- Index is used to calculate stagger delay for entrance animations

**Animation Enhancements:**
- **Entrance Animations**: Cards fade in with upward motion (20px y-axis)
- **Stagger Effect**: Each card delays by `index * 0.1` seconds (0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s, etc.)
- **Hover Effects**: Cards scale up (1.02x) and lift up (-8px) on hover
- **Overlay Animation**: Black overlay with links fades in on hover (already implemented)
- **Image Zoom**: Project images scale up (1.1x) on hover (already implemented)

**Animation Variants:**
```typescript
const cardVariants = {
  hidden: { opacity: 0, y: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : 20 },
  visible: {
    opacity: 1,
    y: 0,
    transition: {
      duration: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : 0.5,
      delay: prefersReducedMotion ? 0 : index * 0.1,
      ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const,
    },
  },
};

const hoverVariants = prefersReducedMotion
  ? {}
  : {
      scale: 1.02,
      y: -8,
      transition: {
        duration: 0.3,
        ease: [0.4, 0, 0.2, 1] as const,
      },
    };
```

#### 2. ProjectsClient Component (`src/app/projects/ProjectsClient.tsx`)

**Grid Rendering Update:**
- Pass `index` prop to each `ProjectCard` component
- Index is derived from the `map` function iteration

**Code Change:**
```typescript
{filteredProjects.map((project, index) => (
  <ProjectCard 
    key={project.id} 
    project={project} 
    index={index} 
    onOpenModal={handleOpenModal} 
  />
))}
```

### Features Implemented

#### ✅ Entrance Animations
- Cards fade in from opacity 0 to 1
- Cards slide up from 20px below their final position
- Smooth cubic-bezier easing: `[0.4, 0, 0.2, 1]`
- Duration: 0.5 seconds

#### ✅ Hover Effects
- Scale animation: 1.02x (subtle zoom)
- Lift animation: -8px upward movement
- Overlay fade-in with action buttons
- Image zoom: 1.1x scale on background image
- Duration: 0.3 seconds

#### ✅ Stagger Animations
- Sequential card appearance with 0.1s delay between each
- Creates a cascading effect across the grid
- Works naturally with responsive grid (1/2/3 columns)
- Stagger resets when filters change (new filtered list)

#### ✅ Reduced Motion Support
- Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- When enabled:
  - No y-axis movement on entrance
  - No stagger delay
  - No hover scale or lift effects
  - Instant transitions (duration: 0)
- Uses existing `useReducedMotion` hook

### Animation Timing

**Normal Motion:**
- Card 1: appears at 0.1s
- Card 2: appears at 0.2s
- Card 3: appears at 0.3s
- Card 4: appears at 0.4s
- And so on...

**Reduced Motion:**
- All cards appear instantly
- No delays or animations

### Performance Considerations

1. **GPU Acceleration**: Uses `transform` properties (scale, translateY) for hardware acceleration
2. **Efficient Easing**: Cubic-bezier easing function optimized for smooth motion
3. **Conditional Rendering**: Animations completely disabled when reduced motion is preferred
4. **No Layout Thrashing**: Animations don't trigger layout recalculations

### Accessibility

- ✅ Respects user's motion preferences
- ✅ Animations don't interfere with keyboard navigation
- ✅ Focus states remain visible during animations
- ✅ Screen readers unaffected by visual animations

### Requirements Met

- ✅ 6.5: Add entrance animations for project cards
- ✅ 6.5: Implement hover effects with scale and overlay
- ✅ 6.5: Add stagger animations for grid items
- ✅ 6.6: Respect prefers-reduced-motion preference

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Testing:**
   - Load project gallery and observe stagger effect
   - Hover over cards to see scale and lift animations
   - Apply filters and observe re-animation of filtered results

2. **Accessibility Testing:**
   - Enable "Reduce Motion" in OS settings
   - Verify all animations are disabled
   - Test keyboard navigation during animations

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Check for smooth 60fps animations
   - Verify no layout shifts during animations
   - Test on mobile devices

### Browser Compatibility

- Modern browsers with Framer Motion support
- Graceful degradation for older browsers
- CSS transforms widely supported
- Media query support for reduced motion

### Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Add exit animations when cards are filtered out
- Implement scroll-triggered animations for lazy-loaded cards
- Add micro-interactions on technology badges
- Consider parallax effects for featured projects
