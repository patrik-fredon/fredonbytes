# Performance Monitoring Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive Web Vitals tracking and Lighthouse CI configuration for the FredonBytes website to monitor and measure performance metrics in real-time.

## Components Created

### 1. WebVitals Component (`src/app/components/WebVitals.tsx`)
- Client-side component using Next.js `useReportWebVitals` hook
- Tracks Core Web Vitals: FCP, LCP, CLS, FID, TTFB, TTI, TBT
- Development mode: Logs metrics to console with detailed information
- Production mode: Sends metrics to `/api/analytics` endpoint
- Uses `navigator.sendBeacon` for reliable metric transmission
- Fallback to `fetch` with `keepalive` for browsers without sendBeacon support
- Silent error handling to avoid disrupting user experience

### 2. Analytics API Endpoint (`src/app/api/analytics/route.ts`)
- POST endpoint at `/api/analytics`
- Receives Web Vitals metrics from the WebVitals component
- Validates incoming metric data
- Logs metrics with timestamp for monitoring
- Includes placeholders for integration with:
  - Google Analytics 4
  - Vercel Analytics
  - Custom analytics database
  - Third-party monitoring services (DataDog, New Relic, etc.)
- Returns success even on errors to avoid disrupting user experience
- Uses `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to disable caching

### 3. Layout Integration (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
- Added WebVitals component to root layout
- Placed inside ClientLayoutWrapper for client-side execution
- Renders as null (no visual output)
- Automatically tracks metrics on all pages

### 4. Lighthouse CI Configuration (`.lighthouserc.json`)
- Already configured with optimal settings:
  - 3 runs per URL for consistency
  - Tests homepage, /links, and /form pages
  - Performance threshold: 95+ score
  - Core Web Vitals assertions:
    - FCP < 1.5s
    - LCP < 2.0s
    - CLS < 0.1
    - TBT < 150ms
  - Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO: 95+ scores
  - Uploads results to temporary public storage

## Usage

### Running Lighthouse CI
```bash
# Run Lighthouse CI tests
npm run lighthouse

# This will:
# 1. Start the production server
# 2. Run 3 Lighthouse audits on each configured URL
# 3. Assert against performance thresholds
# 4. Upload results for review
```

### Viewing Web Vitals in Development
```bash
# Start dev server
npm run dev

# Open browser console to see Web Vitals logs
# Format: [Web Vitals] { name, value, rating, delta, id }
```

### Production Monitoring
- Web Vitals are automatically sent to `/api/analytics` endpoint
- Metrics are logged server-side for monitoring
- Can be integrated with external analytics services

## Metrics Tracked

### Core Web Vitals
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: Time until first content is rendered
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Time until largest content is rendered
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Visual stability metric
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Interactivity metric
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: Server response time
- **TTI (Time to Interactive)**: Time until page is fully interactive
- **TBT (Total Blocking Time)**: Time page is blocked from user input

### Metric Ratings
- **good**: Metric meets performance targets
- **needs-improvement**: Metric is acceptable but could be better
- **poor**: Metric fails performance targets

## Integration Points

### Future Enhancements
1. **Database Storage**: Store metrics in Supabase for historical analysis
2. **Analytics Dashboard**: Create admin dashboard to visualize metrics
3. **Alerting**: Set up alerts for performance degradation
4. **A/B Testing**: Track metrics across different feature variants
5. **User Segmentation**: Analyze metrics by device, browser, location

### External Services Integration
```typescript
// Example: Google Analytics 4
gtag('event', metric.name, {
  value: Math.round(metric.value),
  metric_id: metric.id,
  metric_rating: metric.rating,
});

// Example: Vercel Analytics
import { sendWebVitals } from '@vercel/analytics';
sendWebVitals(metric);
```

## Testing

### Manual Testing
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open browser console
3. Navigate through pages
4. Observe Web Vitals logs

### Automated Testing
1. Build production: `npm run build`
2. Start production server: `npm start`
3. Run Lighthouse CI: `npm run lighthouse`
4. Review results and assertions

## Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Threshold |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Performance Score | ≥ 95 | Error if < 95 |
| FCP | < 1.5s | Error if ≥ 1.5s |
| LCP | < 2.0s | Error if ≥ 2.0s |
| CLS | < 0.1 | Error if ≥ 0.1 |
| TBT | < 150ms | Error if ≥ 150ms |
