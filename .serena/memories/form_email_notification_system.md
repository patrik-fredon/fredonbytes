# Customer Satisfaction Form - Email Notification System

## Completed: Task 5 - Implement Email Notification System

### Files Created/Modified

**Created: src/app/lib/email-templates.ts**
- Email template generation utilities
- `generateAdminNotificationHTML()` function for formatting survey responses
- TypeScript interfaces: `FormResponseData`, `AdminNotificationData`
- XSS protection via `escapeHtml()` helper function
- Responsive HTML email design with FredonBytes branding

**Modified: src/app/api/form/submit/route.ts**
- Integrated Resend API for email notifications
- Added email sending after successful database submission
- Fetches question details to include in email
- Non-blocking error handling for email failures

### Implementation Details

**Email Template Features:**
- Gradient header with FredonBytes branding (matching contact form style)
- Session information display (ID, timestamp, response count)
- Structured response sections with numbered questions
- Visual indicators for answer types
- Next steps section for admin guidance
- Responsive design for all email clients
- XSS protection for user-submitted content

**Email Generation Function:**
```typescript
generateAdminNotificationHTML(data: AdminNotificationData): string
```

**Input Data Structure:**
```typescript
interface AdminNotificationData {
  session_id: string;
  timestamp: string;
  responses: FormResponseData[];
}

interface FormResponseData {
  question_id: string;
  question_text: string;
  answer_value: string | string[];
  answer_type: string;
}
```

**Integration Flow:**
1. Form submission succeeds and data saved to database
2. Fetch question details (text and type) from Supabase
3. Map responses to include question information
4. Generate HTML email using template function
5. Send email via Resend API to info@fredonbytes.cloud
6. Log success or error (non-blocking)
7. Return success response regardless of email status

**Error Handling:**
- Email sending wrapped in try-catch block
- Errors logged to console with session ID for debugging
- Email failures do NOT block form submission
- Success response returned even if email fails
- Graceful degradation if question details can't be fetched

**Email Configuration:**
- **From:** `Customer Feedback <noreply@fredonbytes.cloud>`
- **To:** `info@fredonbytes.cloud`
- **Subject:** `New Customer Satisfaction Survey - {session_id_prefix}`
- **Format:** HTML with inline CSS for email client compatibility

**Security Considerations:**
- All user input escaped via `escapeHtml()` function
- Prevents XSS attacks in email content
- Uses environment variable for Resend API key
- No sensitive data exposed in email subject

### Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 5.7: Admin notification email sent via Resend API after successful submission
- ✅ 5.8: Email includes session_id, timestamp, and formatted responses with question text

### Code Quality

- ✅ Passes TypeScript strict type checking
- ✅ Passes ESLint (3 acceptable warnings from original code)
- ✅ Follows project conventions (import grouping, error handling patterns)
- ✅ Consistent with existing contact form email implementation
- ✅ Includes descriptive comments and type annotations
- ✅ Non-blocking error handling ensures reliability

### Testing Recommendations

To test the email notification system:

1. **Environment Setup:**
   - Ensure `RESEND_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
   - Verify Resend domain is configured for fredonbytes.cloud

2. **Manual Testing:**
   - Submit a test form via the API
   - Check info@fredonbytes.cloud for notification email
   - Verify email formatting and content accuracy
   - Test with various answer types (text, arrays)

3. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Test with invalid Resend API key (should log error but not fail)
   - Test with missing question data (should use fallback text)
   - Verify form submission succeeds even if email fails

### Next Steps

Task 6 will implement the form page with dynamic routing and session management.
