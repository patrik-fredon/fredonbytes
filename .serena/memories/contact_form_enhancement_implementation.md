### Implementation Flow

1. User submits contact form with locale
2. Form data validated with Zod schema
3. Unique session_id generated for survey linking
4. IP address hashed for privacy compliance
5. Contact submission stored in database
6. Newsletter subscription processed (if opted in)
7. Survey link generated: {siteUrl}/survey/{session_id}
8. Customer confirmation email sent with survey link
9. Admin notification email sent with full details
10. survey_sent flag updated in database
11. Success response returned with session_id

### Security Features

- IP address anonymization via SHA-256 hashing
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies on all tables
- Input validation with Zod schemas
- XSS prevention via escapeHtml() function
- Duplicate email handling for newsletter subscriptions
- Privacy-compliant data storage

### Error Handling

- Zod validation errors return 400 with details
- Database errors logged and return 500
- Newsletter subscription errors logged but don't block submission
- Email sending errors logged but don't block submission
- User-friendly error messages in UI

### Locale Support

The system automatically detects the user's locale and:
- Sends emails in the appropriate language
- Stores locale preference in database
- Uses locale for survey link generation
- Supports fallback to English if locale not found

### Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 2.1: Contact form submission with database storage
- ✅ 2.2: Professional HTML email templates with branding
- ✅ 2.3: Customer confirmation email with personalization
- ✅ 2.4: Admin notification email with full details

- ✅ 2.6: Multilingual email support (en, cs, de)
- ✅ 2.7: Error handling and logging
- ✅ 2.8: Zod schema validation

- ✅ 2.10: Database persistence with proper schema

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Migration:**
   - Run migration: `supabase db push`
   - Verify tables created with correct schema
   - Test RLS policies with public access

2. **Form Submission:**
   - Test with all three locales (en, cs, de)
   - Verify database records created
   - Check IP address hashing
   - Test newsletter subscription

3. **Email Delivery:**
   - Verify customer email received with correct locale
   - Verify admin email received with full details
   - Test survey link generation
   - Check HTML and plain text rendering

4. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Test with invalid form data
   - Test with duplicate newsletter email
   - Test with database connection issues
   - Verify error messages displayed to user

### Next Steps

Task 4 will implement the survey system to handle the survey links generated by this contact form enhancement.
