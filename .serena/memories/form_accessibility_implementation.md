# Form Accessibility Implementation

## Overview
Completed task 20: Implemented comprehensive accessibility features for the customer satisfaction form to ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance.

## Files Modified

### 1. src/app/form/[session_id]/FormClient.tsx
**Semantic HTML Structure:**
- Changed outer `<div>` to `<main>` element with `role="main"` and `aria-label="Customer Satisfaction Survey"`
- Wrapped question content in proper `<form>` element with `onSubmit` handler
- Added `<fieldset>` and `<legend>` elements for each question step
- Legend provides context: "Question X of Y" (visually hidden with sr-only class)

**Skip Links:**
- Added skip link at the top of the form for screen reader users
- Link targets `#form-content` to jump directly to the main form area
- Uses sr-only class with focus:not-sr-only to show on keyboard focus
- Styled with high contrast (blue background, white text) when visible

**ARIA Live Regions:**
- Added `role="status"` with `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"`
- Announces current step to screen readers: "Welcome screen", "Question X of Y", "Thank you"
- Announces validation errors when they occur
- Uses sr-only class to hide visually but keep accessible to screen readers

**Focus Management:**
- Added `useRef` hook for `questionContainerRef` to track the question container
- Implemented `useEffect` that runs when `currentStep` changes
- Automatically moves focus to the first input element when navigating to a new question
- Uses 350ms delay (slightly longer than animation duration) to ensure smooth transition
- Queries for first focusable element: `input:not([type="hidden"]), textarea, select, button`
- Only manages focus on question steps (not welcome or thank you screens)

**Form Submission:**
- Form element handles Enter key submission properly
- Prevents default form submission and calls `handleNext()` instead
- Maintains existing validation and navigation logic

### 2. src/app/components/form/FormNavigation.tsx
**Touch Targets:**
- Added `min-h-[44px]` class to both Previous and Next/Submit buttons
- Ensures minimum 44px height for mobile touch accessibility

**ARIA Labels:**
- Added `aria-label="Go to previous question"` to Previous button
- Added dynamic `aria-label` to Next/Submit button:
  - "Submit survey" when on last question
  - "Go to next question" otherwise
- Provides clear context for screen reader users

**Button Type:**
- Changed Next/Submit button from `type="button"` to `type="submit"`
- Allows form submission via Enter key when focused on inputs

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing

   - Verify all labels are announced
   - Verify error messages are announced
   - Verify step changes are announced
   - Test skip link functionality

3. **Touch Device Testing:**
   - Test on iOS and Android devices
   - Verify all buttons are easily tappable
   - Verify radio/checkbox options are easy to select
   - Test in both portrait and landscape orientations

4. **Color Contrast Testing:**
   - Use browser DevTools or axe DevTools
   - Verify all text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1)
   - Test in both light and dark modes
   - Verify focus indicators are visible

5. **Reduced Motion Testing:**
   - Enable prefers-reduced-motion in OS settings
