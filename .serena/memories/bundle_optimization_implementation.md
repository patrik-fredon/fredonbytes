# JavaScript Bundle Optimization Implementation

## Overview
Implemented enhanced JavaScript bundle optimization for the FredonBytes website as part of the performance optimization spec (Task 5).

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Webpack Code Splitting (Task 5.1)
Updated `next.config.ts` with improved code splitting configuration:
- Added **framework chunk** for React/Next.js core libraries (priority 40)
- Added **radixUI chunk** for Radix UI components (priority 35)
- Enhanced **framerMotion chunk** with higher priority (priority 30)
- Maintained **vendor chunk** for other node_modules (priority 20)
- Kept **common chunk** for shared code (priority 10)

All chunks use `enforce: true` for critical libraries to ensure they're always split.

### 2. Expanded optimizePackageImports (Task 5.2)
Extended the package import optimization list in `next.config.ts`:
- lucide-react (already present)
- framer-motion (already present)
- react-hook-form (new)
- @hookform/resolvers (new)
- class-variance-authority (new)
- clsx (new)
- tailwind-merge (new)

Note: Radix UI and date-fns were not added as they are not installed in the project.

### 3. Dynamic Imports for Heavy Components (Task 5.3)

#### Layout.tsx Changes
Converted to dynamic imports:
- **AnimatedBackground**: Uses Framer Motion, loaded dynamically with gradient fallback
- **CookieConsentBanner**: Not needed immediately, loaded dynamically with null fallback

#### Page.tsx Changes
Converted below-the-fold sections to dynamic imports:
- **ProjectsSection**: With skeleton loading fallback
- **PricingSection**: With skeleton loading fallback
- **ContactSection**: With skeleton loading fallback

Above-the-fold sections (HeroSection, AboutSection, ServicesSection) remain static imports for immediate rendering.

## Technical Details

### Dynamic Import Configuration
- Removed `ssr: false` option (not allowed in Next.js 15 Server Components)
- Added loading fallbacks for better UX during component loading
- Used skeleton loaders that match the component structure

### Import Order
Fixed ESLint import order issues:
- `next/dynamic` before `next/font/google`
- All static imports before dynamic component definitions
- Proper spacing between import groups

## Expected Performance Impact

### Bundle Size Reduction
- Framework code separated into dedicated chunk (better caching)
- Heavy animation library (Framer Motion) in separate chunk
- Below-the-fold components loaded on-demand

### Loading Performance
- Reduced initial JavaScript bundle size
- Faster Time to Interactive (TTI)
- Better First Contentful Paint (FCP)
- Improved Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)

### Caching Benefits
- Framework chunk cached separately (rarely changes)
- Vendor chunks cached independently
- Route-specific code loaded only when needed

## Files Modified
1. `next.config.ts` - Enhanced webpack splitting and package optimization
2. `src/app/layout.tsx` - Dynamic imports for AnimatedBackground and CookieConsentBanner
3. `src/app/page.tsx` - Dynamic imports for below-the-fold sections

## Known Issues
Pre-existing TypeScript errors with Framer Motion type definitions exist in the codebase but are unrelated to these changes. The build compiles successfully despite these type warnings.

## Next Steps
The implementation is complete. To verify the improvements:
1. Run `ANALYZE=true npm run build` to analyze bundle sizes
2. Compare chunk sizes before/after
3. Test loading performance with Chrome DevTools
4. Verify dynamic imports work correctly in production
