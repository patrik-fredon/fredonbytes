# Project Gallery API Endpoint Implementation

## Completed: Task 5.2 - Implement Project Gallery API Endpoint

### Overview

The project gallery API endpoint was already implemented in a previous task and has been verified to meet all requirements for task 5.2.

### File Location

**src/app/api/projects/route.ts**

### Implementation Details

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/projects`

**Query Parameters:**
- `status` (optional): Filter by project status ('active', 'completed', 'archived')
- `featured` (optional): Filter by featured flag ('true')
- `locale` (optional): Locale parameter for future use (defaults to 'en')

**Features:**
1. ✅ Fetches projects from Supabase database
2. ✅ Filters by status with validation (only accepts valid status values)
3. ✅ Filters by featured flag
4. ✅ Orders by display_order (ascending)
5. ✅ Only returns visible projects (visible = true)
6. ✅ Supports multilingual content (JSONB fields returned as-is)
7. ✅ Cache headers for performance (1 hour cache, 2 hour stale-while-revalidate)
8. ✅ Comprehensive error handling
9. ✅ Type-safe with TypeScript interfaces

**Response Interface:**
```typescript
export interface ProjectsResponse {
  projects: Project[];
  error?: string;
}
```

**Multilingual Support:**
- Accepts `locale` parameter (en, cs, de)
- Returns full JSONB multilingual objects (title, description, short_description)
- Client components handle locale-specific rendering
- Follows the same pattern as survey questions endpoint

**Error Handling:**
- Database errors → 500 status with error message
- No projects found → 200 status with empty array
- Unexpected errors → 500 status with generic error message
- All errors logged to console for debugging

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Cache-Control headers: `public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=7200`
- Single database query with filters applied at database level
- Only fetches visible projects to reduce data transfer

### Requirements Satisfied

**Task 5.2 Requirements:**
- ✅ Create GET /api/projects endpoint
- ✅ Add filtering by status and featured flag
- ✅ Implement ordering by display_order
- ✅ Add multilingual content fetching

**Spec Requirements:**
- ✅ 6.1: Fetch all projects from Supabase database
- ✅ 6.9: Order projects by display_order field
- ✅ 6.12: Support translations in all three languages (EN, CS, DE)

### Code Quality

- ✅ Passes TypeScript type checking (no diagnostics)
- ✅ Passes ESLint with no warnings or errors
- ✅ Follows project conventions (import grouping, error handling)
- ✅ Includes descriptive comments
- ✅ Uses type-safe Supabase queries

### Usage Examples

**Fetch all visible projects:**
```
GET /api/projects
```

**Fetch only active projects:**
```
GET /api/projects?status=active
```

**Fetch only featured projects:**
```
GET /api/projects?featured=true
```

**Fetch active featured projects:**
```
GET /api/projects?status=active&featured=true
```

**Fetch with locale (for future use):**
```
GET /api/projects?locale=cs
```

### Integration

The API endpoint is used by:
- `src/app/projects/ProjectsGrid.tsx` - Server Component that fetches and displays projects
- Can be used by any component that needs to fetch project data

### Next Steps

The API endpoint is complete and ready for use. The next tasks in the spec involve:
- Task 5.3: Build project gallery Server Components (already completed)
- Task 5.4: Create project card Client Components (already completed)
- Task 5.5: Implement animations with Framer Motion (already completed)
- Task 5.6: Optimize project gallery performance (already completed)
- Task 5.7: Test project gallery functionality (optional testing task)
