# Form Validation Implementation

## Overview
Completed task 14: Implemented comprehensive form validation logic for the customer satisfaction form feature.

## Files Created

### src/app/lib/form-validation.ts
New utility file containing validation functions and interfaces:

#### ValidationError Interface
```typescript
interface ValidationError {
  question_id: string;
  message: string;
}
```

#### validateAnswer() Function
Validates a single answer based on question requirements:
- Returns `ValidationError | null`
- Checks if question is required
- Validates answer format based on answer_type:
  - `short_text`, `long_text`, `single_choice`: Must be non-empty string
  - `multiple_choice`, `checklist`: Must be non-empty array
- Returns appropriate error messages:
  - "This question is required" for missing/empty answers
  - "Please select at least one option" for empty arrays
  - "Invalid question type" for unknown types

#### validateAllAnswers() Function
Validates all required questions have been answered:
- Takes array of questions and Map of answers
- Returns array of ValidationErrors (empty if all valid)
- Iterates through all questions and validates each one
- Useful for pre-submission validation

#### findFirstUnansweredRequired() Function
Helper function to find the first unanswered required question:
- Returns index of first unanswered required question
- Returns -1 if all required questions are answered
- Useful for navigating to first error on submission

## Files Modified

### src/app/form/[session_id]/FormClient.tsx

#### Import Added
```typescript
import { validateAnswer } from '@/app/lib/form-validation';
```

#### FormState Interface Updated
Added `validationError` field to track current question validation:
```typescript
interface FormState {
  // ... existing fields
  validationError: string | null; // Error message for current question validation
}
```

#### State Initialization Updated
Added `validationError: null` to initial state

#### handleNext() Function Enhanced
- Uses `validateAnswer()` to check current question before navigation
- Sets `validationError` state if validation fails
- Prevents navigation when validation fails
- Clears validation error on successful navigation
- Clears validation error when moving from welcome screen

#### handleAnswerChange() Function Enhanced
- Clears `validationError` when user provides/changes an answer
- Provides immediate feedback that error is resolved
- Works in both success and error paths (localStorage available or not)

## Validation Rules

### Required Questions
- Must have a non-null, non-undefined answer
- String answers must not be empty or whitespace-only
- Array answers must have at least one element

### Optional Questions
- Always pass validation (return null)
- No validation performed if question.required is false

### Answer Type Validation
- **short_text**: Must be non-empty string
- **long_text**: Must be non-empty string
- **single_choice**: Must be non-empty string
- **multiple_choice**: Must be non-empty array
- **checklist**: Must be non-empty array

## User Experience Flow

1. User attempts to navigate forward with handleNext()
2. If on a question, validateAnswer() checks the answer
3. If validation fails:
   - Navigation is prevented
   - validationError is set in state
   - Error message will be displayed by QuestionStep component (task 10)
4. When user provides/changes answer:
   - validationError is cleared immediately
   - User can try navigation again
5. If validation passes:
   - validationError is cleared
   - Navigation proceeds to next step

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 3.7: Validation error prevents navigation from required unanswered questions
- ✅ 5.1: All required questions validated before submission
- ✅ 5.2: Validation errors include question_id and error message

## Integration Points
- Used by FormClient.tsx handleNext() function
- Will be used by task 15 (form submission) with validateAllAnswers()
- Error messages will be displayed by QuestionStep component (task 10)
- Works with existing Question and AnswerValue types from supabase.ts

## Type Safety
- Full TypeScript typing throughout
- No type assertions needed
- Proper null/undefined handling
- Type guards for string vs array answers

## Code Quality
- Passes TypeScript strict mode checks
- No ESLint errors or warnings
- Follows project conventions
- Clear, readable code with JSDoc comments
- Comprehensive validation logic

## Next Steps
- Task 15: Use validateAllAnswers() in form submission flow
- Task 10: Display validationError in QuestionStep component
- Task 17: Enhance error handling with ErrorState component
