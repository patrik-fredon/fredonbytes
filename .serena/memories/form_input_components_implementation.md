  - Keyboard navigation (arrow keys)
  - Visual selection indicators
  - Proper ARIA role and attributes

  - Indeterminate state for partial selection
  - Visual divider between "Select All" and options
  - Count indicator (X / Y selected)

  - Proper ARIA attributes for group
  - Dark mode support

## Common Interface

All input components share a consistent interface:

```typescript
interface InputComponentProps {
  value: string | string[]
  onChange: (value: string | string[]) => void
  required: boolean
  error?: string
  questionId: string
  questionText: string
  options?: QuestionOption[]
}
```

## Design Patterns

### Styling
- Consistent FredonBytes brand colors (blue-500/600 for primary)
- Dark mode support throughout
- Smooth transitions (200ms duration)
- Focus rings for accessibility
- Error states with red borders

### Accessibility
- Proper ARIA labels and roles
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Screen reader announcements for character counters
- Focus management
- Semantic HTML structure

### User Experience
- Visual feedback for selections
- Character counters with color-coded warnings
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Touch-friendly targets (44px minimum)
- Clear error states

## Integration Notes

The QuestionStep component (`src/app/components/form/QuestionStep.tsx`) currently has TODO comments indicating where these components should be integrated. The integration would involve:

1. Importing the input components
2. Replacing the placeholder implementations in the switch statement
3. Passing the correct props to each component

This integration is likely part of a separate task or was meant to be completed as part of task 10.

## Verification

- All components pass TypeScript type checking
- No linting errors
- Consistent with project code style conventions
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance
