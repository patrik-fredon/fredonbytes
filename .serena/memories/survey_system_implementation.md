# Survey System Implementation

## Completed: Task 4 - Create survey system database schema and implementation

### Overview
Successfully implemented a complete customer satisfaction survey system that integrates with the contact form. The survey system includes database schema, API endpoints, routing, and reusable form components. This implementation follows the enhanced-user-experience spec requirements 3.1-3.10.

### Database Schema

**survey_questions table:**
- id (UUID, primary key)
- question_text (JSONB) - Multilingual: {en: "...", cs: "...", de: "..."}
- description (JSONB, optional) - Multilingual
- answer_type (text) - short_text, long_text, single_choice, multiple_choice, checklist, rating
- required (boolean)
- display_order (integer, unique)
- active (boolean)
- created_at, updated_at (timestamps)

**survey_question_options table:**
- id (UUID, primary key)
- question_id (UUID, foreign key to survey_questions)
- option_text (JSONB) - Multilingual
- display_order (integer)
- created_at (timestamp)
- Unique constraint on (question_id, display_order)

**survey_sessions table:**
- session_id (UUID, primary key)
- contact_submission_id (UUID, foreign key to contact_submissions)
- created_at (timestamp)
- completed_at (timestamp, nullable)
- ip_address_hash (text, SHA-256 hashed)
- user_agent (text)
- locale (text, default 'en')

**survey_responses table:**
- id (UUID, primary key)
- session_id (UUID, foreign key to survey_sessions)
- question_id (UUID, foreign key to survey_questions)
- answer_value (JSONB) - Supports string, array, or number
- submitted_at (timestamp)
- Unique constraint on (session_id, question_id)

### Sample Survey Questions

The migration includes 5 sample questions:

1. **Rating Question**: "How satisfied are you with our initial response?" (required)
2. **Rating Question**: "How would you rate the clarity of our communication?" (required)
3. **Checklist Question**: "What aspects of our service are most important to you?" (required)
   - Options: Quality of work, Communication, Timeliness, Pricing, Technical expertise
4. **Single Choice Question**: "How did you hear about FredonBytes?" (optional)
   - Options: Google search, Social media, Referral, Online advertisement, Other
5. **Long Text Question**: "Do you have any additional comments or suggestions?" (optional)

### Implementation Flow

1. User submits contact form
2. Contact API creates contact_submissions record with unique session_id
3. Contact API creates survey_sessions record linked to contact submission
4. Customer receives confirmation email with survey link: /survey/{session_id}
5. User clicks survey link and lands on survey page
6. Survey page validates session_id format
7. SurveyClient fetches questions via GET /api/survey/questions
8. API validates session exists and is not completed
9. API returns active questions with multilingual content
10. User completes multi-step survey form
11. Answers saved to localStorage for persistence
12. User submits survey via POST /api/survey/submit
13. API validates session and prevents duplicate submissions
14. API stores responses in survey_responses table
15. API updates survey_sessions.completed_at
16. API updates contact_submissions.survey_completed flag
17. User sees thank you screen
18. localStorage cleared after successful submission

### Component Reuse

The survey system successfully reuses existing form components:
- **FormBackground** - Animated gradient background
- **FormNavigation** - Previous/Next/Submit buttons
- **QuestionStep** - Question rendering with validation
- **WelcomeScreen** - Introduction screen
- **ThankYouScreen** - Completion screen
- **FormLoadingSkeleton** - Loading state
- **ErrorState** - Error handling UI

Input components reused:
- **ShortTextInput** - For short_text questions
- **LongTextInput** - For long_text questions
- **SingleChoiceInput** - For single_choice questions
- **MultipleChoiceInput** - For multiple_choice questions
- **ChecklistInput** - For checklist questions

### Multilingual Support

The system supports three locales (en, cs, de):
- Question text stored as JSONB: {en: "...", cs: "...", de: "..."}
- Option text stored as JSONB with same structure
- Locale determined from survey session (inherited from contact form)
- LocalizedString helper function extracts appropriate translation
- Fallback to English if translation missing

### Security Features

- Session validation prevents unauthorized access
- Duplicate submission prevention via completed_at check
- IP address anonymization via SHA-256 hashing
- XSS prevention via input sanitization
- RLS policies restrict access to active questions only
- No-cache headers for session-specific data
- UUID validation for session_id format

### Error Handling

- Invalid session ID format shows error message
- Expired/non-existent session shows friendly error
- Completed survey shows "already completed" message
- Network errors show retry option
- Validation errors highlight specific questions
- Submission errors show modal with retry button
- LocalStorage failures logged but don't block functionality

### Performance Optimizations

- Dynamic import of ThankYouScreen (lazy loading)
- LocalStorage for answer persistence
- Optimized animations with will-change CSS
- Reduced motion support for accessibility
- Efficient state management with React hooks
- Batch insert for survey responses
- Indexes on frequently queried columns

### Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 3.1: Survey page with dynamic routing (/survey/[session_id])
- ✅ 3.2: Session validation and question fetching from database
- ✅ 3.3: Multi-step form interface (reused from /form)
- ✅ 3.4: Response storage in survey_responses table
- ✅ 3.5: Linking to contact submission via session_id

- ✅ 3.7: Error handling for invalid/expired sessions
- ✅ 3.8: Admin configuration through database
- ✅ 3.9: Duplicate submission prevention
- ✅ 3.10: Multilingual support (en, cs, de)

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Database Migration:**
   - Run migration: `supabase db push`
   - Verify tables created with correct schema
   - Test RLS policies with public access
   - Verify sample questions inserted

2. **Survey Access:**
   - Submit contact form to generate survey link
   - Click survey link from email
   - Verify session validation works
   - Test with invalid session_id format
   - Test with expired/non-existent session

3. **Survey Completion:**
   - Complete all required questions
   - Test validation for required fields
   - Test different answer types (text, choice, rating)
   - Verify localStorage persistence
   - Test submission and thank you screen

4. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Test duplicate submission prevention
   - Test network errors during submission
   - Test invalid answer formats
   - Verify error messages displayed correctly

5. **Multilingual:**
   - Test survey in all three locales (en, cs, de)
   - Verify translations display correctly
   - Test fallback to English for missing translations

### Next Steps

Task 5 will implement the dynamic project gallery with database integration.
