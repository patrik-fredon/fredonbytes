Features:
- Collapsible filter panel with toggle button
- Status filtering (Active, Completed, Archived)
- Technology filtering with multi-select
- Active filter count badge
- Clear all filters button
- Framer Motion animations for panel expand/collapse
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion preference
- Accessible with ARIA attributes
- Dark mode support

#### 2. ProjectModal Component

Features:
- Full-screen modal with backdrop blur
- Detailed project view with large image
- Complete project description (not truncated)
- All technologies displayed
- Featured and status badges
- Creation date display
- Action buttons for live demo and GitHub
- Close on Escape key
- Prevents body scroll when open
- Click outside to close
- Framer Motion enter/exit animations
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion preference
- Accessible with proper ARIA roles and labels
- Dark mode support

#### 3. ProjectsClient Component
**File:** `src/app/projects/ProjectsClient.tsx`

Features:
- Client-side state management for filters and modal
- Extracts unique technologies from all projects
- Filters projects by status and technologies (AND logic)
- Opens modal when project card is clicked
- Handles modal open/close with animation timing
- Clear filters functionality
- Empty state when no projects match filters
- Responsive grid layout (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)

#### 4. Enhanced ProjectCard Component
**File:** `src/app/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`

Enhancements:
- Added `onOpenModal` callback prop
- Click handler to open modal (prevents opening when clicking links)
- Keyboard navigation support (Enter/Space to open modal)
- Cursor pointer and role="button" for accessibility
- Stop propagation on link clicks to prevent modal opening
- Maintains all existing features (animations, hover effects, badges, etc.)

### Integration

**Updated:** `src/app/projects/ProjectsGrid.tsx`
- Removed dynamic import of ProjectCard
- Now renders ProjectsClient component
- Passes fetched projects to client component
- Maintains server-side data fetching
- Maintains empty state for no projects

### Architecture

**Server Components:**
- `ProjectsGrid` - Fetches data from Supabase, passes to client

**Client Components:**
- `ProjectsClient` - Manages filter and modal state
- `ProjectCard` - Interactive card with animations
- `ProjectFilter` - Filter UI with animations
- `ProjectModal` - Modal dialog with animations

### Features Implemented

1. **Filtering:**
   - Filter by project status (single selection)
   - Filter by technologies (multiple selection with AND logic)
   - Visual indication of active filters
   - Clear all filters button
   - Empty state when no matches

2. **Modal View:**
   - Click any project card to view details
   - Full project description
   - All technologies listed
   - Links to live demo and GitHub
   - Keyboard accessible (Escape to close)
   - Click outside to close
   - Smooth animations

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Mobile: 1 column grid
   - Tablet: 2 column grid
   - Desktop: 3 column grid
   - Filter panel adapts to screen size
   - Modal scrollable on small screens

4. **Accessibility:**
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - ARIA labels and roles
   - Focus management
   - Semantic HTML
   - Screen reader friendly

5. **Performance:**
   - Client-side filtering (no API calls)
   - Memoized filter calculations
   - Optimized re-renders
   - Lazy image loading
   - Reduced motion support

### Requirements Met

- ✅ 6.3: Responsive grid layout on multiple devices
- ✅ 6.4: Smooth animations with Framer Motion
- ✅ 6.7: Hover effects with animated overlay
- ✅ 6.8: Links to GitHub and live demo

### Usage

The project gallery now supports:
1. Browse all projects in a responsive grid
2. Filter by status and/or technologies
3. Click any project to view full details in modal
4. Access GitHub and live demo links from card or modal
5. Clear filters to reset view

All components respect user preferences for reduced motion and support dark mode.
