- **SEO**: Comprehensive meta tags, canonical URLs, and structured data
- **Accessibility**: Proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation

- ✅ All task requirements fulfilled:
  - New contact page created at `/[locale]/contact`
  - ContactSection content moved to dedicated page
  - Mobile responsiveness maintained
  - Proper meta tags and internationalization added
  - Navigation updated to link to new contact page
