# Form Answer Persistence Implementation

## Overview
Completed task 13: Implemented answer persistence with localStorage in the FormClient component.

## File Modified

### src/app/form/[session_id]/FormClient.tsx

#### Import Updates
- Added `saveAnswer` to imports from `@/app/lib/form-storage`
- Now imports: `{ loadAnswers, saveAnswer }`

#### New Function: handleAnswerChange

**Location:** Lines 144-177

**Signature:**
```typescript
const handleAnswerChange = (questionId: string, value: AnswerValue) => void
```

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Immediate localStorage Persistence**
   - Calls `saveAnswer(sessionId, questionId, value)` immediately when answer changes
   - Ensures data is persisted before any other operations

2. **State Update**
   - Creates new Map instance from existing answers (immutable update pattern)
   - Sets the new answer value for the question ID
   - Updates formState with new answers Map

3. **Error Handling**
   - Wraps localStorage operation in try-catch block
   - Catches any localStorage failures (QuotaExceededError, unavailable storage)
   - Logs error to console for debugging
   - Still updates component state even if localStorage fails
   - Ensures form remains functional even without persistence

4. **Graceful Degradation**
   - If localStorage fails, form continues to work with in-memory state
   - User can still complete the form in the current session
   - Comment notes potential future enhancement for user notification (toast)

## Key Features

### Synchronous State Management
- Updates both localStorage and component state in single operation
- Ensures consistency between persisted and in-memory data
- Uses Map data structure for O(1) lookups

### Error Resilience
- Never blocks user interaction due to storage failures
- Maintains form functionality even when localStorage is unavailable
- Provides clear error logging for debugging

### Type Safety
- Uses AnswerValue type from supabase.ts
- Properly typed questionId (string) and value (AnswerValue)
- TypeScript strict mode compliant

## Integration Points

### Called By (Future Tasks)
- QuestionStep component (task 10) - will pass this handler to input components
- Input components (task 11) - will call this when user changes answers

### Calls
- `saveAnswer()` from form-storage.ts (task 2)
- `setFormState()` React state setter

### State Updates
- Updates `formState.answers` Map with new answer
- Preserves all other formState properties (questions, currentStep, etc.)

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 4.1: Immediate answer saving to localStorage
- ✅ 4.2: Structured format keyed by session_id (via saveAnswer utility)
- ✅ 4.5: Graceful handling of unavailable localStorage

## Code Quality
- Passes TypeScript strict mode checks
- No ESLint errors or warnings
- Follows project conventions (immutable state updates, error handling)
- Clear comments explaining behavior
- Proper error logging without exposing to user

## Usage Pattern

When implemented in QuestionStep/input components:

```typescript
// In QuestionStep component
<ShortTextInput
  value={answer}
  onChange={(value) => handleAnswerChange(question.id, value)}
  required={question.required}
/>
```

## Next Steps
- Task 14: Implement form validation logic
- Task 15: Implement form submission flow (will use the persisted answers)
- Tasks 10-11: Wire up handleAnswerChange to input components

## Testing Considerations
- Test with localStorage available (normal case)
- Test with localStorage disabled (privacy mode)
- Test with localStorage quota exceeded
- Test rapid answer changes (debouncing not needed - saveAnswer is fast)
- Test answer updates for different question types (text, arrays)
