# Form Navigation Component Implementation

## Overview
Completed task 12: Created the FormNavigation component for the customer satisfaction form feature.

## File Created

### src/app/components/form/FormNavigation.tsx
A reusable client component that provides navigation controls for the form with progress tracking.

## Component Interface

```typescript
interface FormNavigationProps {
  currentStep: number;      // 0 = welcome, 1-n = questions, n+1 = thank you
  totalSteps: number;       // Total number of questions
  canGoNext: boolean;       // Whether next navigation is allowed
  canGoPrevious: boolean;   // Whether previous navigation is allowed
  isSubmitting: boolean;    // Whether form is being submitted
  onPrevious: () => void;   // Previous button handler
  onNext: () => void;       // Next button handler
}
```

## Key Features

### Progress Indicator
- Displays "Question X of Y" text
- Only shown when on a question step (not welcome or thank you screens)
- Centered above navigation buttons
- Uses muted text color for subtle appearance

### Previous Button
- Conditionally rendered based on `canGoPrevious` prop
- Hidden on welcome screen (when `canGoPrevious` is false)
- Uses "outline" variant from Button component
- Includes ChevronLeft icon from lucide-react
- Disabled during form submission
- Responsive width: full width on mobile, auto on desktop

### Next/Submit Button
- Dynamic text: "Next" for questions, "Submit" on last question
- Uses "default" variant for Next, "gradient" variant for Submit
- Includes ChevronRight icon for Next button (not on Submit)
- Shows loading spinner during submission via Button's `loading` prop
- Disabled during form submission
- Responsive width: full width on mobile, flex-1 on desktop

## Responsive Design

### Mobile (< 640px)
- Vertical layout (flex-col)
- Full-width buttons
- Stacked Previous above Next/Submit
- 12px gap between buttons

### Desktop (≥ 640px)
- Horizontal layout (flex-row)
- Previous button: auto width with min-width 140px
- Next/Submit button: flex-1 with min-width 140px
- 16px gap between buttons

## Styling Details

### Button Variants
- **Previous**: outline variant (transparent with border)
- **Next**: default variant (solid dark background)
- **Submit**: gradient variant (blue to purple gradient with shadow)

### Button Sizes
- All buttons use "lg" size (h-11, px-8)
- Consistent sizing for professional appearance

### Icons
- ChevronLeft (20px) for Previous button
- ChevronRight (20px) for Next button
- No icon on Submit button (loading spinner shows instead)

## Accessibility

- Semantic button elements with type="button"
- Proper disabled states
- Loading state with spinner and aria-label
- Keyboard navigation supported via Button component
- Focus indicators from Button component

## Integration Points

### With FormClient
The component expects these props from FormClient:
- `currentStep`: from FormState.currentStep
- `totalSteps`: from FormState.questions.length
- `canGoNext`: validation logic (always true for now, will be enhanced in task 14)
- `canGoPrevious`: from FormClient's canGoPrevious calculation
- `isSubmitting`: from FormState.isSubmitting
- `onPrevious`: FormClient's handlePrevious function
- `onNext`: FormClient's handleNext function

### With Button Component
Uses the existing Button component from `@/app/components/common/Button`:
- Leverages variant system (outline, default, gradient)
- Uses size prop (lg)
- Uses loading prop for submission state
- Uses leftIcon/rightIcon props for chevrons
- Inherits all accessibility features

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 3.4: Previous button implementation with proper visibility
- ✅ 3.5: Next/Submit button with dynamic text
- ✅ Progress indicator showing current question number
- ✅ Responsive layout (mobile-first approach)
- ✅ Loading state during submission
- ✅ Uses existing Button component with appropriate variants

## Type Safety

- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Explicit interface for props
- No type errors or warnings
- Passes strict mode checks

## Code Quality

- Clean, readable code with JSDoc comments
- Follows project naming conventions
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Proper component composition
- No ESLint errors or warnings

## Next Steps

This component is ready to be integrated into FormClient (task 13+) to replace the placeholder navigation buttons. It will work seamlessly with:
- Task 13: Answer persistence (will use onNext handler)
- Task 14: Form validation (will use canGoNext prop)
- Task 15: Form submission (will use isSubmitting prop)

## Usage Example

```tsx
<FormNavigation
  currentStep={formState.currentStep}
  totalSteps={formState.questions.length}
  canGoNext={true} // Will be validation result in task 14
  canGoPrevious={canGoPrevious}
  isSubmitting={formState.isSubmitting}
  onPrevious={handlePrevious}
  onNext={handleNext}
/>
```
