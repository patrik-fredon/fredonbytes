# Project Gallery Implementation

## Completed: Task 5 - Create Project Gallery Database Schema and Components

### Database Schema

**Migration File:** `supabase/migrations/20251011150000_projects_gallery.sql`

Created `projects` table with:
- Multilingual fields (title, description, short_description) using JSONB
- Image URL, GitHub link, live demo link
- Technologies array (JSONB)
- Status field (active, completed, archived)
- Display order with unique constraint
- Featured and visible flags
- Timestamps (created_at, updated_at)
- Indexes on display_order, status, featured, visible, created_at
- RLS policy for public read access (visible = true)
- Auto-update trigger for updated_at timestamp

**Sample Data:** 4 projects seeded with translations in EN, CS, DE

### TypeScript Interfaces

**File:** `src/app/lib/supabase.ts`

Added:
- `Project` interface with LocalizedString fields
- Database type definition for projects table
- Insert/Update types for type-safe queries

### API Endpoint

**File:** `src/app/api/projects/route.ts`

GET endpoint with:
- Optional filtering by status (active, completed, archived)
- Optional filtering by featured flag
- Ordering by display_order
- Only returns visible projects
- Cache headers (1 hour cache, 2 hour stale-while-revalidate)
- Error handling and logging
- Type-safe response interface

### Server Components

**Files:**
- `src/app/projects/page.tsx` - Main page with metadata and Suspense boundary
- `src/app/projects/ProjectsGrid.tsx` - Server Component that fetches projects from Supabase
- `src/app/projects/ProjectsLoadingSkeleton.tsx` - Loading skeleton for Suspense fallback

Features:
- Server-side data fetching with Supabase client
- Suspense boundary for streaming SSR
- Empty state handling
- Error handling with fallback to empty array

### Client Components

**File:** `src/app/projects/ProjectCard.tsx`

Features:
- Framer Motion animations (entrance, hover effects)
- Respects prefers-reduced-motion preference
- Multilingual support (reads locale from URL query param)
- Next.js Image optimization with lazy loading
- Featured and status badges
- Hover overlay with GitHub and live demo links
- Technology tags (shows first 4, then +N)
- Image error handling with fallback
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

### Performance Optimizations

1. **Lazy Loading:** Next.js Image component with lazy loading
2. **Dynamic Imports:** ProjectCard dynamically imported with loading state
3. **Streaming SSR:** Suspense boundaries for progressive rendering
4. **Caching:** API responses cached for 1 hour
5. **Optimized Images:** WebP/AVIF with responsive sizes
6. **Reduced Motion:** Respects user preference for animations

### Architecture Patterns

- **Server-First:** Page and grid are Server Components
- **Client Boundaries:** Only ProjectCard is a Client Component (for animations)
- **Type Safety:** Strict TypeScript with Supabase types
- **Security:** RLS policies enforce visible = true
- **Accessibility:** Semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization:** Multilingual content with fallback to English

### Next Steps

To use the project gallery:
1. Run the migration: `supabase db push` or apply via Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to `/projects` to view the gallery
3. Add more projects via Supabase dashboard or SQL inserts
4. Projects are automatically ordered by display_order
5. Toggle visible flag to show/hide projects

### Integration with Homepage

The existing `ProjectsSection.tsx` component can be updated to fetch from the database instead of using hardcoded data, or kept as-is for a curated homepage showcase while `/projects` shows the full gallery.
