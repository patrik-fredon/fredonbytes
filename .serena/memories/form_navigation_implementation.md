# Form Navigation Implementation

## Overview
Completed task 8: Implemented form navigation logic with validation for the customer satisfaction form feature.

## File Modified

### src/app/form/[session_id]/FormClient.tsx
Added comprehensive navigation logic to the FormClient component:

## Key Implementation Details

### Navigation Handlers

#### handleNext()
- **Welcome Screen (step 0)**: Moves to first question (step 1)
- **Question Steps (1-n)**: 
  - Validates required questions before allowing navigation
  - Checks if answer exists and is not empty (handles both string and array types)
  - Prevents navigation if validation fails (logs warning)
  - Moves to next question if validation passes
- **Last Question**: Moves to thank you screen (step n+1)
- **Validation Logic**:
  - Checks if current question is required
  - Validates string answers are not empty/whitespace
  - Validates array answers have at least one item
  - Prevents navigation if validation fails

#### handlePrevious()
- Prevents going back from welcome screen (step 0)
- Decrements currentStep by 1 for all other steps
- No validation needed when going backward

### Navigation State Variables

#### canGoPrevious
- Boolean flag: `currentStep > 0`
- Used to disable Previous button on welcome screen
- Enables Previous button on all other screens

#### isOnLastQuestion
- Boolean flag: `currentStep === questions.length`
- Used to determine button text

#### nextButtonText
- Dynamic text: "Submit" on last question, "Next" otherwise
- Changes based on `isOnLastQuestion` flag

## UI Implementation (Testing Placeholder)

Added comprehensive testing UI to verify navigation:
- Displays current step with context (Welcome/Question X of Y/Thank You)
- Shows Previous and Next/Submit buttons
- Previous button disabled when `!canGoPrevious`
- Displays current question text and required indicator
- Shows question info panel when on a question step

## Validation Behavior

### Required Question Validation
- Checks if answer exists in answers Map
- For string answers: validates not empty and not just whitespace
- For array answers: validates array has at least one element
- Logs warning to console when validation fails
- Prevents step increment when validation fails
- Error display will be handled by QuestionStep component (task 10)

### Navigation Flow
```
Step 0 (Welcome) → Step 1 (Q1) → ... → Step N (Last Q) → Step N+1 (Thank You)
     ↑                ↑                        ↑
     |                |                        |
  No Previous    Can go back            Submit button
```

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 3.2: User clicks "Next" on welcome screen → transitions to first question
- ✅ 3.3: User on question (not first) → displays both Previous and Next buttons
- ✅ 3.4: User clicks "Previous" → navigates to previous question
- ✅ 3.5: User clicks "Next" → navigates to next question
- ✅ 3.7: User attempts to proceed from required question without answering → validation error prevents navigation

## Type Safety
- All navigation logic properly typed with TypeScript
- Uses existing FormState interface
- Proper type checking for answer validation (string vs array)

## Code Quality
- Passes TypeScript strict mode checks
- No ESLint errors or warnings
- Clean, readable code with comments
- Follows project conventions

## Integration Points
- Uses FormState.currentStep for navigation tracking
- Uses FormState.answers Map for validation
- Uses FormState.questions array for question data
- Integrates with existing state management pattern

## Next Steps
- Task 9: Create WelcomeScreen component (will use handleNext)
- Task 10: Create QuestionStep component (will display validation errors)
- Task 12: Create FormNavigation component (will use canGoPrevious, nextButtonText, handlers)
- Task 14: Implement form validation logic (will enhance validation)
- Task 15: Implement form submission flow (will use handleNext on last question)

## Testing Notes
- Current UI shows navigation state for testing
- Can verify step transitions work correctly
- Can verify Previous button disabled on welcome screen
- Can verify Next button changes to Submit on last question
- Can verify validation prevents navigation (check console warnings)
- Testing UI will be replaced with actual components in tasks 9-12
