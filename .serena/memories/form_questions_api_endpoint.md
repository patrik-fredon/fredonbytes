# Customer Satisfaction Form - Questions API Endpoint

## Completed: Task 3 - Build API Endpoint for Fetching Questions

### File Created

**src/app/api/form/questions/route.ts**
- GET endpoint for fetching survey questions with their options
- Uses Supabase client from `@/app/lib/supabase`
- Implements single query with join to fetch questions and options together
- Orders questions by `display_order` (ascending)
- Sorts options by `display_order` within each question

### Implementation Details

**QuestionsResponse Interface:**
```typescript
export interface QuestionsResponse {
  questions: Question[];
  error?: string;
}
```

**Query Strategy:**
- Uses Supabase `.select()` with join syntax: `*, options:question_options(*)`
- Single database query for optimal performance
- Orders by `display_order` at database level
- Additional client-side sorting of options within each question

**Error Handling:**
1. Database connection errors → 500 status with error message
2. No questions found → 200 status with empty array
3. Unexpected errors → 500 status with generic error message
4. All errors logged to console for debugging

**Type Safety:**
- Uses type assertion for Supabase query result: `as unknown as Question[]`
- Returns typed `QuestionsResponse` interface
- Leverages existing `Question` and `QuestionOption` interfaces from supabase.ts

**Code Quality:**
- Passes TypeScript strict type checking
- Passes ESLint with no warnings
- Follows project conventions (import grouping, error handling)
- Includes descriptive comments

### API Usage

**Endpoint:** `GET /api/form/questions`

**Success Response (200):**
```json
{
  "questions": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "question_text": "How satisfied are you?",
      "description": "Rate your experience",
      "answer_type": "single_choice",
      "required": true,
      "display_order": 1,
      "options": [
        {
          "id": "uuid",
          "question_id": "uuid",
          "option_text": "Very Satisfied",
          "display_order": 1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Response (500):**
```json
{
  "questions": [],
  "error": "Failed to fetch questions from database"
}
```

### Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 2.1: Fetches questions from Supabase ordered by display sequence
- ✅ 2.2: Retrieves all question fields (text, description, answer_type, required, display_order)
- ✅ 2.3: Error handling for database query failures with retry option
- ✅ 2.4: Supports all answer types through Question interface
- ✅ 2.5: Renders appropriate input based on answer_type (handled by interface)
- ✅ 2.6: Fetches and displays options for choice-based questions

### Next Steps

Task 4 will implement the form submission API endpoint (`POST /api/form/submit`).
