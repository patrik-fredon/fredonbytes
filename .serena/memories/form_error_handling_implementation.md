# Form Error Handling Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive error handling and recovery system for the customer satisfaction form (Task 17).

## Components Created

### 1. ErrorState Component (`src/app/components/form/ErrorState.tsx`)
- Reusable component for displaying user-friendly error messages
- Features:
  - Flexible props for different error scenarios (error, warning, info icons)
  - Customizable action buttons with loading states
  - Support contact information display
  - Responsive design matching form styling
  - Uses existing Button component for consistency

### 2. Error Logging Utility (`src/app/lib/error-logger.ts`)
- Provides consistent error logging across the form
- Functions:
  - `logError()`: Logs errors with context and metadata
  - `getUserFriendlyErrorMessage()`: Converts technical errors to user-friendly messages
- Features:
  - Different logging behavior for development vs production
  - Prepared for integration with error tracking services (e.g., Sentry)
  - Handles network, timeout, database, and validation errors

## Integration in FormClient

### Error Scenarios Handled

1. **Question Loading Failures**
   - Uses ErrorState component with retry button
   - Logs error with context: 'QuestionLoading'
   - Provides user-friendly error message
   - Retry function: `retryLoadQuestions()`

2. **Submission Failures**
   - Shows error modal overlay with ErrorState
   - Logs error with context: 'FormSubmission'
   - Retains localStorage data for retry
   - Provides retry and close actions
   - Separate state: `submissionError`

3. **localStorage Failures**
   - Logs error with context: 'LocalStorageSave'
   - Continues with in-memory state
   - Graceful degradation

4. **Invalid Session ID**
   - Already handled in page.tsx
   - Generates new UUID and redirects
   - No error shown to user (seamless recovery)

## Error State Management

Added `submissionError` to FormState for modal display:
```typescript
interface FormState {
  // ... other fields
  error: string | null;           // For question loading errors
  submissionError: string | null; // For submission errors (modal)
  validationError: string | null; // For validation errors
}
```

## User Experience

- Question loading errors: Full-page ErrorState with retry
- Submission errors: Modal overlay with retry/close options
- Support contact: info@fredonbytes.cloud displayed in all error states
- Consistent styling with existing form design
- Accessible with proper ARIA attributes

## Requirements Satisfied

✅ 9.1: Network error handling with user-friendly messages and retry
✅ 9.2: Submission errors preserve localStorage and allow retry
✅ 9.3: Invalid session_id handled with redirect (in page.tsx)
✅ 9.4: localStorage quota errors handled gracefully
✅ 9.5: Database connection failures show error with support contact
✅ 9.6: Progress preserved in localStorage for 24 hours
✅ 9.7: Questions with no options handled (would show error)
✅ 9.8: Email notification failures logged but don't block submission
