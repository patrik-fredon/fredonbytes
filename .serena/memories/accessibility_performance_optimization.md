# Accessibility Performance Optimization

## Overview
Completed task 12: Implemented comprehensive accessibility performance optimizations to ensure the website is performant with assistive technologies and respects user preferences.

## Files Created

### 1. src/app/hooks/useReducedMotion.ts
**Purpose:** Custom React hook to detect user's reduced motion preference

**Implementation:**
- Detects `prefers-reduced-motion` media query
- Returns boolean indicating if user prefers reduced motion
- Listens for changes to the preference
- Client-side only with proper SSR handling
- Automatic cleanup of event listeners

**Usage:**
```typescript
const prefersReducedMotion = useReducedMotion()
```

## Files Modified

### 1. src/app/components/common/AnimatedBackground.tsx
**Changes:**
- Imported and used `useReducedMotion` hook
- Updated `floatingVariants` to disable animations when reduced motion is preferred
- Updated `orbitVariants` to disable animations when reduced motion is preferred
- Updated `pulseVariants` to disable animations when reduced motion is preferred
- Updated animated particles to respect reduced motion preference
- Updated geometric shapes animations to respect reduced motion preference

**Impact:**
- All background animations now respect user's motion preferences
- Provides static background when reduced motion is enabled
- Maintains visual design without motion

### 2. src/app/form/[session_id]/FormClient.tsx
**Changes:**
- Imported and used `useReducedMotion` hook
- Updated `slideVariants` to use no movement when reduced motion is preferred
- Updated `slideTransition` duration to 0.01ms when reduced motion is preferred
- Maintains opacity transitions but removes sliding motion

**Impact:**
- Form navigation respects reduced motion preference
- Instant transitions instead of animated slides
- Improves accessibility for users sensitive to motion

### 3. src/app/components/form/QuestionStep.tsx
**Changes:**
- Imported and used `useReducedMotion` hook
- Updated error message shake animation to respect reduced motion
- Removes shake effect when reduced motion is preferred
- Maintains instant appearance of error messages

**Impact:**
- Error messages appear instantly without shake animation
- Improves accessibility for users sensitive to motion
- Maintains error visibility and feedback

### 4. src/app/components/form/WelcomeScreen.tsx
**Changes:**
- Imported and used `useReducedMotion` hook
- Updated initial scale animation to respect reduced motion
- Removes scale animation when reduced motion is preferred
- Maintains instant appearance of welcome screen

**Impact:**
- Welcome screen appears instantly without scale animation
- Improves accessibility for users sensitive to motion

### 5. src/app/components/form/ThankYouScreen.tsx
**Changes:**
- Imported and used `useReducedMotion` hook
- Updated container scale animation to respect reduced motion
- Updated success checkmark spring animation to respect reduced motion
- Removes all animations when reduced motion is preferred

**Impact:**
- Thank you screen appears instantly without animations
- Success checkmark appears instantly without rotation/scale
- Improves accessibility for users sensitive to motion

## Existing Optimizations Verified

### 1. Keyboard Navigation Performance
**Status:** Already optimized

**Features:**
- Instant focus indicators with `outline: 2px solid` (no transition delay)
- Consistent focus styles across all interactive elements
- `focus-visible` pseudo-class for keyboard-only focus indicators
- `focus:ring-2 focus:ring-blue-500` for visible focus rings
- No transitions on focus indicators (instant feedback)

**Global CSS Rules:**
```css
*:focus {
  outline: 2px solid var(--ring);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}

*:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--ring);
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

### 2. Semantic HTML Structure
**Status:** Verified and compliant

**Structure:**
- `<html>` with `lang="en"` attribute
- `<header>` element for site header
- `<nav>` element for navigation
- `<main>` element for main content
- `<footer>` element for site footer
- `<section>` elements for content sections
- `<article>` elements where appropriate

**Heading Hierarchy:**
- Single `<h1>` per page (in HeroSection)
- `<h2>` for section titles
- `<h3>` for subsection titles
- `<h4>` for sub-subsection titles
- Proper nesting without skipping levels

**ARIA Labels:**
- All interactive elements have proper `aria-label` attributes
- Form inputs have `aria-describedby` linking to errors/descriptions
- Form groups have `role="group"` or `role="radiogroup"`
- Live regions use `aria-live="polite"` for announcements
- Buttons have descriptive `aria-label` attributes
- Navigation has proper ARIA attributes

### 3. Reduced Motion Support
**Status:** Fully implemented

**Global CSS Rule:**
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  *,
  *::before,
  *::after {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    scroll-behavior: auto !important;
  }
}
```

**Component-Level Support:**
- All Framer Motion animations respect reduced motion
- Custom hook provides consistent detection
- Animations disabled or reduced to instant transitions
- Maintains functionality without motion

- ✅ Consistent focus styles across all elements
- ✅ Visible focus rings with proper contrast
- ✅ No performance penalty for keyboard navigation

### Requirement 12.3: Accessibility Performance - Reduced Motion

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing
1. **Reduced Motion Testing:**
   - Enable "Reduce motion" in OS settings (macOS: System Preferences > Accessibility > Display)
   - Verify all animations are disabled or reduced
   - Test form navigation, background animations, and transitions
   - Verify functionality remains intact

2. **Keyboard Navigation Testing:**
   - Tab through entire site without mouse
   - Verify focus indicators are visible and instant
   - Test form inputs, buttons, and navigation
   - Verify no focus traps or inaccessible elements

3. **Screen Reader Testing:**
   - Test with NVDA (Windows), JAWS (Windows), or VoiceOver (Mac)
   - Verify heading hierarchy is announced correctly
   - Verify ARIA labels are read properly
   - Test form inputs and error messages
   - Verify live regions announce changes

4. **Semantic HTML Testing:**
   - Use browser DevTools to inspect HTML structure
   - Verify proper use of semantic elements
   - Check heading hierarchy (h1 > h2 > h3 > h4)
   - Verify ARIA attributes are present and correct

### Automated Testing Tools
- axe DevTools browser extension
- WAVE accessibility checker
- Lighthouse accessibility audit
- Pa11y or similar CI/CD tools

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts:
- Reduced motion improves performance for users who prefer it
- Instant focus indicators have no performance overhead
- Semantic HTML improves parsing speed for assistive technologies
- Proper ARIA labels improve screen reader performance

### No Negative Impacts:
- Custom hook adds minimal overhead (single media query listener)
- Conditional animations have no performance penalty
- Global CSS rules are efficient and well-supported

## Code Quality
- All changes pass TypeScript strict mode checks
- No ESLint errors or warnings
- Follows existing project conventions
- Maintains consistency with design system
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Browser Compatibility
- `prefers-reduced-motion` supported in all modern browsers
- `matchMedia` API widely supported
- Fallback behavior: animations enabled by default
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Next Steps
- Task 13: Browser Compatibility Testing
- Task 14: Performance Testing and Validation
- Task 15: Documentation and Deployment
