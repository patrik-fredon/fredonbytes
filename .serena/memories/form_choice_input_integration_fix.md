# Form Choice Input Integration Fix

## Issue
The form was not rendering chosen answers correctly - checkboxes and radio buttons appeared unchecked even when selected.

## Root Cause
The QuestionStep component (`src/app/components/form/QuestionStep.tsx`) was using placeholder HTML implementations with basic native inputs instead of the custom input components that were already created with proper visual styling.

## Solution
Integrated the custom input components into QuestionStep:

### Changes Made to QuestionStep.tsx

1. **Added Imports** (lines 6-8):
   ```typescript
   import SingleChoiceInput from '@/app/components/form/inputs/SingleChoiceInput'
   import MultipleChoiceInput from '@/app/components/form/inputs/MultipleChoiceInput'
   import ChecklistInput from '@/app/components/form/inputs/ChecklistInput'
   ```

2. **Replaced single_choice case**:
   - Removed placeholder HTML radio buttons
   - Now uses `<SingleChoiceInput>` component with proper props
   - Passes value, onChange, required, error, questionId, questionText, and options

3. **Replaced multiple_choice case**:
   - Removed placeholder HTML checkboxes
   - Now uses `<MultipleChoiceInput>` component with proper props
   - Handles array values correctly

4. **Replaced checklist case**:
   - Removed placeholder HTML checkboxes
   - Now uses `<ChecklistInput>` component with proper props
   - Includes "Select All" functionality

## Custom Component Features

All three custom components include:
- **Visual Selection Indicators**: Custom styled checkboxes/radio buttons with checkmarks
- **Selected State Styling**: Blue borders and backgrounds when selected
- **Hover States**: Visual feedback on hover
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Arrow key support
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA attributes
- **Dark Mode Support**: Full dark mode styling
- **Touch-Friendly**: 44px minimum touch targets

## Verification
- TypeScript compilation: âœ… No errors
- All components properly imported and integrated
- Props correctly passed with type safety

## Note
The short_text and long_text inputs still use placeholder implementations. These could be replaced with ShortTextInput and LongTextInput components if they exist, but they work fine as-is since text inputs don't have the same visual selection issue.
