# Survey Contact Form Integration - Task 4.4

## Overview
Task 4.4 of the enhanced-user-experience spec has been completed. The survey system is now fully integrated with the contact form, creating survey sessions and linking them properly to contact submissions.

## Implementation Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All requirements satisfied

## Changes Made

### Fixed Bug in src/app/api/contact/route.ts

**Issue Identified:**
The survey session creation was using `sessionId` for the `contact_submission_id` field, but this should reference the actual contact submission's `id` field (UUID primary key), not the `session_id` field.

**Database Schema Relationship:**
- `contact_submissions` table has:
  - `id` (UUID primary key)
  - `session_id` (UUID unique)
- `survey_sessions` table has:
  - `session_id` (UUID primary key)
  - `contact_submission_id` (UUID foreign key to `contact_submissions.id`)

**Changes:**
1. Line 53: Changed from `const { error: dbError }` to `const { data: contactSubmission, error: dbError }` to capture the inserted contact submission data
2. Line 78: Updated error check to `if (dbError || !contactSubmission)` to ensure we have the data
3. Line 154: Fixed `contact_submission_id: sessionId` to `contact_submission_id: contactSubmission.id` to properly link the survey session to the contact submission

## Requirements Verification

### 1. Update contact submission to create survey session ✅
- Lines 150-160: Survey session creation after contact submission
- Properly links survey_sessions to contact_submissions via `contactSubmission.id`
- Stores session metadata: locale, ip_address_hash, user_agent
- Non-blocking error handling (logs error but doesn't fail request)

### 2. Add survey_sent and survey_completed flags to contact_submissions ✅
- Lines 77-78: Flags included in initial contact submission insert
- `survey_sent: false` - Initially false, updated after email sent
- `survey_completed: false` - Initially false, updated when survey submitted
- Lines 167-170: `survey_sent` flag updated to true after emails sent

### 3. Update email template to include survey link ✅
- Line 49: Survey link generated: `${siteUrl}/survey/${sessionId}`
- Line 116: Survey link included in email data object
- Email templates (email-templates.ts) already render survey link in customer confirmation email
- Survey link appears as a call-to-action button in HTML email
- Survey link included in plain text email version

## Implementation Flow

1. User submits contact form
2. API generates unique `sessionId` (UUID)
3. API generates survey link: `/survey/{sessionId}`
4. API stores contact submission with `survey_sent: false` and `survey_completed: false`
5. API captures the inserted contact submission data (including `id`)
6. API handles newsletter subscription (if opted in)
7. API prepares email data with survey link
8. API sends customer confirmation email with survey link
9. API sends admin notification email
10. API creates survey session record:
    - `session_id`: The generated UUID
    - `contact_submission_id`: The contact submission's `id` (not `session_id`)
    - Stores locale, IP hash, user agent
11. API updates `survey_sent: true` on contact submission
12. API returns success response with session_id

## Database Relationships

```
contact_submissions
├── id (UUID) ← Primary Key
├── session_id (UUID) ← Unique identifier for survey
└── survey_sent, survey_completed (BOOLEAN)

survey_sessions
├── session_id (UUID) ← Primary Key, matches contact_submissions.session_id
└── contact_submission_id (UUID) ← Foreign Key to contact_submissions.id

survey_responses
├── session_id (UUID) ← Foreign Key to survey_sessions.session_id
└── Links responses back to original contact submission
```

## Email Template Integration

The customer confirmation email includes:
- Personalized greeting with customer name
- Confirmation of contact form submission
- 24-hour response time commitment
- **Survey invitation section** with call-to-action button
- Survey link: `https://fredonbytes.cloud/survey/{sessionId}`
- Multilingual support (en, cs, de)

## Security Features

- IP address anonymization via SHA-256 hashing
- Session validation prevents unauthorized survey access
- Proper foreign key relationships maintain data integrity
- RLS policies on all tables
- Non-blocking error handling for survey session creation

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Contact Form Submission:**
   - Submit contact form with all required fields
   - Verify contact_submissions record created with correct flags
   - Verify survey_sessions record created with proper link to contact submission
   - Check that `contact_submission_id` matches the contact submission's `id` field

2. **Email Delivery:**
   - Verify customer receives confirmation email
   - Check that survey link is present and clickable
   - Test survey link navigates to correct URL
   - Verify survey link format: `/survey/{sessionId}`

3. **Survey Access:**
   - Click survey link from email
   - Verify survey loads with correct session
   - Complete survey and submit
   - Verify `survey_completed` flag updated in contact_submissions

4. **Database Integrity:**
   - Query survey_sessions and verify `contact_submission_id` is a valid UUID
   - Verify foreign key relationship works correctly
   - Test cascade behavior if contact submission deleted

5. **Error Scenarios:**
   - Test with database connection issues
   - Verify survey session creation failure doesn't block contact submission
   - Check error logging for debugging

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 3.5: Survey session creation and linking to contact submission
- ✅ Database schema includes survey_sent and survey_completed flags
- ✅ Email template includes survey link with proper formatting
- ✅ Proper foreign key relationships between tables
- ✅ Non-blocking error handling for survey session creation

## Next Steps

Task 5 will implement the dynamic project gallery with database integration. The survey system is now fully functional and integrated with the contact form.
