# Image Optimization Audit Implementation

## Overview
Completed comprehensive image optimization audit for the FredonBytes website as part of the performance optimization spec (Task 6).

## Changes Made

### Subtask 6.1: Image Usage Audit
- ✅ Verified all images use Next.js Image component
- ✅ No `<img>` tags found in the codebase
- ✅ Found 4 Image component usages across components

### Subtask 6.2: Image Loading Strategy Optimization

#### HeroSection.tsx
- Logo image (above-the-fold)
- Added `quality={85}` for high-quality hero image
- Added `sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 448px, 672px"`
- Already had `priority` prop ✓

#### AboutSection.tsx
- Team member profile images (below-the-fold)
- Added `loading="lazy"` for deferred loading
- Added `quality={80}` for balanced quality/size
- Added `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 96px, (max-width: 1024px) 96px, 96px"` (fixed 96px avatar size)

#### ProjectsSection.tsx
- Project showcase images (below-the-fold)
- Added `loading="lazy"` for deferred loading
- Added `quality={80}` for balanced quality/size
- Added `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw"` for responsive grid

#### ProfileHeader.tsx
- Logo image (above-the-fold)
- Added `quality={85}` for high-quality logo
- Added `sizes="128px"` (fixed size)
- Already had `priority` prop ✓

### Subtask 6.3: Image Format Configuration Verification
Verified in `next.config.ts`:
- ✅ WebP and AVIF formats enabled: `formats: ["image/webp", "image/avif"]`
- ✅ Appropriate deviceSizes: `[640, 768, 1024, 1280, 1536]`
- ✅ Appropriate imageSizes: `[16, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384]`
- ✅ Cache TTL set to 7 days: `minimumCacheTTL: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7`

## Performance Impact

### Above-the-fold Images
- Hero logo and profile logo use `priority` prop for immediate loading
- Quality set to 85 for crisp appearance
- Proper sizes attribute for responsive optimization

### Below-the-fold Images
- Team member and project images use `loading="lazy"`
- Quality set to 80 for optimal balance
- Responsive sizes attributes for bandwidth optimization

### Expected Benefits
1. **Reduced Initial Load**: Lazy loading defers below-the-fold images
2. **Bandwidth Optimization**: Responsive sizes serve appropriate image sizes
3. **Format Optimization**: WebP/AVIF provide better compression
4. **Cache Efficiency**: 7-day cache TTL reduces repeat requests
5. **Quality Balance**: 80-85 quality provides good visuals with smaller file sizes

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ Requirement 5.1: All images use Next.js Image component
- ✅ Requirement 5.2: WebP format enabled with fallback
- ✅ Requirement 5.3: AVIF format enabled for supported browsers
- ✅ Requirement 5.4: Lazy loading for below-the-fold images
- ✅ Requirement 5.5: Priority loading for above-the-fold images
- ✅ Requirement 5.6: Appropriate quality settings (75-85)
- ✅ Requirement 5.8: Proper caching headers configured

## Files Modified
1. `src/app/components/homepage/HeroSection.tsx`
2. `src/app/components/homepage/AboutSection.tsx`
3. `src/app/components/homepage/ProjectsSection.tsx`
4. `src/app/components/linktree/ProfileHeader.tsx`

## Testing Notes
- All TypeScript diagnostics passed
- No build errors introduced
- Image optimization is automatic via Next.js Image component
- Verify in production that WebP/AVIF formats are served correctly
- Check Network tab to confirm lazy loading behavior

## Next Steps
The next tasks in the performance optimization spec are:
- Task 7: Font Loading Optimization
- Task 8: CSS Optimization and Purging
- Task 9: Performance Monitoring Implementation
