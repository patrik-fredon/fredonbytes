# Header Navigation Update - Task 8 Completion

## Task Summary
Updated the header navigation for the new page structure as part of the mobile-responsive-refactor spec.

## Changes Made

### Header Component Update
- **File**: `src/app/components/common/Header.tsx`
- **Change**: Updated the projects navigation item from `isRoute: false` to `isRoute: true`
- **Reason**: The projects page is now a dedicated page (created in previous tasks) and should use proper routing instead of hash linking

### Navigation Items Configuration
```javascript
const navItems = [
  { href: "/about", key: "navigation.about", isRoute: true },
  { href: "#services", key: "navigation.services", isRoute: false },
  { href: "/projects", key: "navigation.projects", isRoute: true }, // Changed from false to true
  { href: "/pricing", key: "navigation.pricing", isRoute: true },
  { href: "/contact", key: "navigation.contact", isRoute: true },
];
```

### Fixed Linting Issue
- **File**: `src/app/components/homepage/ProjectsSection.tsx`
- **Issue**: Import order linting error
- **Fix**: Added proper spacing between import groups

## Requirements Addressed
- ✅ 1.1: Mobile navigation functionality maintained
- ✅ 1.2: Mobile hamburger menu includes all page links
- ✅ 7.1: Navigation links point to dedicated pages
- ✅ 7.2: Homepage sections have proper CTA routing

## Testing
- Development server started successfully on port 3001
- Navigation structure verified
- All dedicated pages (about, pricing, contact, projects) now properly linked

## Impact
- Projects link now properly routes to `/projects` page instead of homepage section
- Mobile and desktop navigation both updated consistently
- All existing functionality preserved
- Translation keys already in place for all navigation items

## Status
Task 8 completed successfully. Header navigation now properly supports the new page structure with dedicated pages for about, pricing, contact, and projects.
