# Form Animations Implementation

## Overview
Implemented comprehensive Framer Motion animations for the customer satisfaction form, including slide transitions, fade effects, and accessibility support.

## Implementation Details

### FormClient Component (`src/app/form/[session_id]/FormClient.tsx`)

#### Animation State Management
- Added `direction: 'forward' | 'backward'` to FormState interface to track navigation direction
- Direction is set to 'forward' when moving to next step or submitting
- Direction is set to 'backward' when moving to previous step

#### Animation Variants
```typescript
const slideVariants = {
  enter: (direction) => ({
    x: direction === 'forward' ? 100 : -100,
    opacity: 0,
  }),
  center: {
    x: 0,
    opacity: 1,
  },
  exit: (direction) => ({
    x: direction === 'forward' ? -100 : 100,
    opacity: 0,
  }),
};
```

#### Transition Configuration
- Type: 'tween' for consistent timing
- Easing: 'easeInOut' for smooth acceleration/deceleration
- Duration: 0.3s (300ms) for optimal perceived performance
- Optimized for 60fps with `will-change: transform, opacity`

#### AnimatePresence Wrapper
- Mode: 'wait' to ensure exit animations complete before enter animations start
- Custom prop: passes direction to variants for conditional animations
- Wraps all three screen types: WelcomeScreen, QuestionStep, ThankYouScreen

#### Screen-Specific Animations
1. **WelcomeScreen**: Fade-in with scale (already implemented in component)
2. **QuestionStep**: Slide transitions based on navigation direction
3. **ThankYouScreen**: Fade-in with scale + spring animation for checkmark (already implemented in component)

### QuestionStep Component (`src/app/components/form/QuestionStep.tsx`)
- Removed outer motion wrapper to avoid conflicts with FormClient's AnimatePresence
- Kept motion wrapper for error shake animation
- Error animation: shake effect with x-axis movement [0, -10, 10, -10, 10, 0]

### Accessibility Features

#### Prefers-Reduced-Motion Support
- Global CSS in `src/app/globals.css` already implements prefers-reduced-motion
- All animations reduced to 0.01ms duration when user prefers reduced motion
- Scroll behavior set to 'auto' instead of 'smooth'

#### Performance Optimizations
- Used `will-change: transform, opacity` on animated elements
- Tween animations instead of spring for predictable performance
- Transform-based animations (not position) for GPU acceleration
- 300ms duration balances smoothness with perceived speed

## Animation Flow

### Forward Navigation (Next/Submit)
1. Current screen exits with slide-left and fade-out
2. Next screen enters from right with slide-in and fade-in
3. Duration: 300ms total

### Backward Navigation (Previous)
1. Current screen exits with slide-right and fade-out
2. Previous screen enters from left with slide-in and fade-in
3. Duration: 300ms total

### Validation Errors
1. Error message appears with shake animation
2. Duration: 400ms
3. Movement: horizontal shake with 6 keyframes

## Key Features
- ✅ AnimatePresence wrapper for exit animations
- ✅ Slide-right animation for forward navigation
- ✅ Slide-left animation for backward navigation
- ✅ Fade-in animation for WelcomeScreen
- ✅ Spring animation for ThankYouScreen checkmark
- ✅ Shake animation for validation errors
- ✅ Prefers-reduced-motion support
- ✅ 60fps performance optimization

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test navigation forward and backward through all questions
2. Verify animations respect prefers-reduced-motion setting
3. Check performance on low-end devices
4. Test with screen readers to ensure animations don't interfere
5. Verify smooth 60fps on mobile devices
