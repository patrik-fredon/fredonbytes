# Implementation Tasks: Dedicated About Page

**Feature Branch**: `001-dedicated-about-page`
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Total Tasks**: 23
**Status**: Ready for Implementation

## Overview

This task breakdown implements the Dedicated About Page feature with static content, internationalization, and light architecture. Tasks are organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Implementation Strategy**: MVP-first approach starting with User Story 1 (navigation), then User Story 2 (company story), followed by User Story 3 (team profiles). All user stories can be implemented in parallel once foundational tasks are complete.

## Dependencies

**User Story Completion Order**:
- User Story 1 (P1) - Navigation: Blocking prerequisite for all other stories
- User Story 2 (P1) - Company Story: Independent, can run parallel to US3 after US1
- User Story 3 (P2) - Team Profiles: Independent, can run parallel to US2 after US1

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- After completing foundational tasks and US1, US2 and US3 can be developed simultaneously
- Translation updates can be done in parallel across all user stories
- Component styling can be parallelized once basic structure is in place

## Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] T001 Create TypeScript type definitions in src/lib/types/about.ts
- [ ] T002 Create static team member data structure in src/lib/team-data.ts
- [ ] T003 Update translation files with About page keys in src/messages/en.json, src/messages/cs.json, src/messages/de.json

## Phase 2: Foundational

- [ ] T004 Create About page route structure in src/app/[locale]/about/page.tsx
- [ ] T005 Create About components directory structure in src/components/about/
- [ ] T006 Update navigation to include About link in existing navigation component

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Navigate to Dedicated About Page (P1)

**Goal**: Visitors can access a dedicated About page through main navigation
**Independent Test**: Click "About" link in navigation and verify page loads with placeholder content

- [ ] T007 [US1] Implement basic About page layout with heading and sections in src/app/[locale]/about/page.tsx
- [ ] T008 [US1] Add navigation link to About page in existing navigation component
- [ ] T009 [US1] Test navigation routing to /en/about, /cs/about, /de/about routes

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Read Company Origin Story (P1)

**Goal**: Visitors can read emotional, inspiring story about Fredon's developer journey and "All-in-One digital army" concept
**Independent Test**: View story section and verify inspirational narrative displays correctly

- [ ] T010 [US2] Create CompanyStory component in src/components/about/CompanyStory.tsx
- [ ] T011 [US2] Implement emotional company story content with founder journey narrative
- [ ] T012 [US2] Add CompanyStory component to About page layout
- [ ] T013 [US2] Style company story with proper typography and spacing using Tailwind CSS
- [ ] T014 [US2] Implement Framer Motion entrance animations for story section
- [ ] T015 [US2] Ensure company story meets AAA WCAG accessibility standards

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Explore Team Profiles (P2)

**Goal**: Visitors can view detailed profiles of all team members including photos, positions, mottos, and professional summaries
**Independent Test**: View team member cards and verify each contains photo, name, position, motto, and summary

- [ ] T016 [US3] Create TeamMemberCard component in src/components/about/TeamMemberCard.tsx
- [ ] T017 [US3] Implement placeholder avatar fallback for missing photos in TeamMemberCard
- [ ] T018 [US3] Create TeamSection component with responsive grid layout in src/components/about/TeamSection.tsx
- [ ] T019 [US3] Add TeamSection component to About page layout
- [ ] T020 [US3] Style team member cards with hover effects using Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion
- [ ] T021 [US3] Ensure team section meets AAA WCAG accessibility standards with keyboard navigation

## Final Phase: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

- [ ] T022 Optimize images to WebP format with lazy loading in public/images/team/
- [ ] T023 Validate Core Web Vitals performance targets (FCP <1.5s, LCP <2.5s, CLS <0.1)
- [ ] T024 Run Lighthouse accessibility audit and ensure >95 score
- [ ] T025 Test responsive design across mobile, tablet, and desktop breakpoints
- [ ] T026 Validate all translations display correctly in Czech, English, and German
- [ ] T027 Final integration testing of complete About page functionality

## Task Summary

**Setup Phase**: 3 tasks (T001-T003)
**Foundational Phase**: 3 tasks (T004-T006)
**User Story 1**: 3 tasks (T007-T009)
**User Story 2**: 6 tasks (T010-T015)
**User Story 3**: 6 tasks (T016-T021)
**Polish Phase**: 6 tasks (T022-T027)

**Parallel Opportunities**:
- Translation tasks (T003) can be done in parallel with setup
- US2 and US3 implementation can run in parallel after foundational tasks
- Styling and accessibility tasks can be parallelized within each user story
- Performance optimization and testing can be done in parallel

**MVP Scope**: Complete User Story 1 (navigation) + basic User Story 2 (company story) for initial release, with User Story 3 as follow-up enhancement.

**Quality Gates**:
- All TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- ESLint reports zero warnings
- Lighthouse scores meet targets (>95 performance, >95 accessibility)
- All user stories pass independent testing criteria
- Cross-browser compatibility verified</content>
