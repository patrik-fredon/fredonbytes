# Research & Technical Decisions

**Feature**: Dedicated About Page
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Complete

## Research Findings

### Next.js App Router with Internationalization

**Decision**: Use Next.js 15 App Router with `[locale]` dynamic segments for clean URL structure.

**Rationale**: App Router provides better performance and developer experience compared to Pages Router. The `[locale]` pattern enables clean URLs like `/en/about` and `/cs/about` while maintaining SEO benefits.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pages Router with `getStaticProps` - Rejected due to inferior performance and complexity
- Client-side routing only - Rejected due to SEO and accessibility concerns

### Component Architecture

**Decision**: Create dedicated components in `components/about/` directory with clear separation of concerns.

**Rationale**: Modular components enable better maintainability and testing. CompanyStory handles narrative content, TeamSection manages the grid layout, and TeamMemberCard encapsulates individual profile logic.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single monolithic component - Rejected due to poor maintainability
- Page-level composition only - Rejected due to lack of reusability

### Performance Optimization Strategy

**Decision**: Implement light implementation with static content, lazy loading for images, and minimal JavaScript.

**Rationale**: Static content ensures fast loading times. Image lazy loading prevents blocking the main thread. Minimal JavaScript bundle keeps Core Web Vitals within targets.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Dynamic content loading - Rejected due to increased complexity and performance overhead
- Heavy JavaScript animations - Rejected due to impact on Core Web Vitals

### Accessibility Implementation

**Decision**: Implement AAA WCAG 2.1 compliance with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and keyboard navigation.

**Rationale**: Screen reader compatibility requires proper heading hierarchy and ARIA labels. Keyboard navigation ensures usability for motor-impaired users. Semantic HTML provides better context for assistive technologies.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Basic accessibility only - Rejected due to constitution requirement for AAA compliance
- Over-engineering with complex ARIA - Rejected due to light implementation constraint

### Internationalization Approach

**Decision**: Use next-intl with JSON files in `messages/` directory, maintaining existing translation structure.

**Rationale**: next-intl provides excellent TypeScript support and integrates seamlessly with Next.js App Router. Maintaining existing file structure ensures consistency with current translations.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Built-in Next.js i18n - Rejected due to inferior TypeScript support
- Third-party libraries - Rejected due to unnecessary complexity

### Error Handling Strategy

**Decision**: Implement graceful degradation without complex error boundaries or fallback mechanisms.

**Rationale**: Light implementation constraint prohibits robust error handling. Graceful degradation (showing placeholder avatars) maintains usability while keeping code simple.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Comprehensive error boundaries - Rejected due to light implementation requirement
- No error handling - Rejected due to poor user experience

### Image Optimization

**Decision**: Use WebP format with lazy loading and placeholder avatars for failed loads.

**Rationale**: WebP provides better compression than JPEG/PNG. Lazy loading improves performance. Placeholder avatars maintain layout integrity when images fail.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- No optimization - Rejected due to performance impact
- Complex image processing pipeline - Rejected due to light implementation constraint

### Animation Strategy

**Decision**: Use Framer Motion for subtle entrance animations and hover effects.

**Rationale**: Framer Motion provides smooth, performant animations that enhance user experience without impacting Core Web Vitals significantly.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CSS animations only - Rejected due to complexity and performance concerns
- No animations - Rejected due to reduced user engagement

## Technical Specifications

### Component Specifications

```

### Translation Structure

**About Page Translations**:
```json
{
  "about": {
    "title": "About FredonBytes",
    "companyStory": { ... },
    "team": {
      "title": "Our Team",
      "members": [ ... ]
    }
  }
}
```
