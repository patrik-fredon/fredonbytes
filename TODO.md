## Completed Work

### âœ… Mobile Navigation Improvements (2025-11-01)

Fixed mobile navigation overlay and enhanced with terminal/dev theme:

**Issues Fixed:**
- Z-index positioning (mobile nav now properly overlays full viewport)
- Changed from `relative` to `fixed` positioning for full-screen overlay
- Added backdrop overlay with proper layering

**Enhancements:**
- Improved hamburger icon with neon glow effects and spring animations
- Terminal/dev-themed styling with glass effects and grid background
- Neon cyan accents for nav items, electric purple for external links
- Terminal-style symbols and mono font throughout
- Custom scrollbar with neon theme
- Touch-optimized with proper feedback states

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/common/Header.tsx` - Fixed positioning and enhanced styling
- `src/app/globals.css` - Enhanced animations and added z-index utilities

See `mobile_navigation_improvements` memory for full technical details.

### âœ… MDX + ISR Implementation (2025-01-06)

All legal documentation pages optimized with MDX content management and ISR caching.

See `CHANGELOG.md` for full details.

## Active Tasks

### ðŸ§ª Email System Testing Required

After fixing contact form email bugs, verify:
- [ ] Test contact form submission with valid SMTP credentials
- [ ] Confirm customer receives email with survey link
- [ ] Confirm admin receives notification email
- [ ] Test error handling with invalid SMTP config
- [ ] Verify `.env.local` has correct settings:
  - `SMTP_HOST=smtp.forpsi.com`
  - `SMTP_PORT=465` (or 587)
  - `SMTP_SECURE=true` (for port 465) or `false` (for port 587)
  - `SMTP_USER=noreply@fredonbytes.cloud`
  - `SMTP_PASS=your_password`

## Future Considerations

When new pages or features are added:
- Follow established MDX + ISR pattern for content pages
- Use terminal/dev theme styling for consistent look
- Ensure proper z-index layering for overlays
- Maintain mobile-first responsive design
- Test across different screen sizes and devices
