# TODO - Current Session

## ✅ Completed: Fixed Terminal Animation Loop (Nov 1, 2025)

### Issues Fixed
1. **Removed duplicate logo display** - Logo was appearing in both left column and right column heading
2. **Added animation restart** - Terminal now loops: types complete code → shows "Compiled ✓" for 3 seconds → resets and restarts

### Implementation
- Logo now only displays once in left column above terminal
- Animation sequence: Building → Compiling → Compiled ✓ → Wait 3s → Reset → Restart
- Clean reset of all terminal line states before restarting animation
- Proper state management to prevent duplication

### Files Modified
- `/src/components/homepage/HeroSection.tsx`: Fixed layout and added restart logic

---

**Session Status**: Complete
**Animation Behavior**: Continuous loop with 3-second pause between cycles
